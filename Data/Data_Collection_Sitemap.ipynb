Rice Dr. H. Ray Hoops Dr. Linda L. M. Bennett 8600 University Blvd 812-464-8600 Email Dr. David L. Rice Dr. David L. Rice was the first dean appointed to lead the Evansville campus of Indiana State University in 1967, two years after its opening. In 1971, he was named president of campus and in 1976, Indiana State University also named him a vice president of the main campus. Under his leadership, the Evansville campus evolved into a separate state university, University of Southern Indiana, regarded for its excellent educational programs and innovative regional outreach projects. When he retired in 1994, it was noted that Rice was one of a handful of contemporary University presidents who had led their institution for at least 25 years. The focus of Dr. Rice’s presidency for 27 years was on serving students well, improving the educational attainment level of southern Indiana, positively impacting economic and workforce development and matching innovative faculty interests with the communities of southern Indiana. During his tenure, enrollment grew to over 7,400 on a master-planned campus with 1,400 acres. Dr. Rice oversaw the expansion of curricula from limited two-year degree programs to a comprehensive range of baccalaureate and master’s degree programs, as well as many cooperative programs with other universities. Under his leadership, USI became the first baccalaureate institution in Indiana to have a degree-transfer articulation agreement with Ivy Tech Community College, paving the way for the State of Indiana to develop a statewide community college system. Term of Office 1967-1994 Education Dr. Rice earned his bachelor, master, and doctor of philosophy degrees at Purdue University. Professional Background Dr. Rice was a faculty member and served as director of Research at Ball State University, in Muncie, Indiana. He also served as vice president with the Cooperative Education Research Laboratory in Indianapolis and research coordinator in the Bureau of Research in the U.S. Office of Education in Washington, D.C. He was president of the Board of Commissioners of the Evansville Housing Authority and chairman of the Governor’s Citizens Advisory Committee for Title XX of the Social Services Act. A founder of Leadership Evansville, he also served as its president. Dr. Rice was general chairman of the Fund Drive of the United Way of Southwestern Indiana, chairman of the board of WNIN Channel 9 Public Television, Explorer Chairman of the Buffalo Trace Council Boy Scouts; and president of the Indiana Public Broadcasting Society. He also served on the Board of the Evansville Museum of Arts, History and Science; the Indiana Business Modernization and Technology Corporation; the Chamber of Commerce of Southwest Indiana; The Villages, Inc.; Youth Resources; and Evansville Coalition of Adult Literacy; and was active in Rotary. In professional circles, he served the Indiana Conference for Higher Education as its president, and chaired former Congressman Lee Hamilton’s Southern Indiana Rural Development Project. Dr. Rice earned many accolades from public service organizations, including the Junior Achievement Distinguished Business Leader Award, Salvation Army Service to Others Award, West Side Civitan Citizen of the Year, the National Community Leadership Conference Leadership Alumni Award, Rotary Civic Award, Boy Scouts Distinguished Citizen Award, and a Sagamore of the Wabash conferred by the Governor of Indiana. In recognition of this University leadership, both the USI Faculty Senate and the USI Alumni Council endowed scholarships in his name. The University Library was named in his honor and both he and Mrs. Rice received honorary doctorates from USI. Upon retirement from the presidency of USI, he and Mrs. Rice moved to New Harmony, Indiana, where they became active in historic preservation and community restoration. As a volunteer, Dr. Rice led the funding campaign and directed the $2.5 million restoration of the Rapp Owen Granary. It was dedicated in 1999 and is now an important center for historical and cultural events in New Harmony. As a commissioner for the bi-state bridge between New Harmony and Illinois, he was an ardent advocate for state and federal funding to stabilize and re-open the structure.

      "        By participating in the Employer Deferment Program, the payment deadline is extended up to 30 days after the semester ends.\n",
      "        Failure to pay by the deadline will result in a hold on the student's account, restricting access to official transcripts and incurring additional charges.\n",

      "\n",
      "Internships can be non-credit or credit-earning experiences. If you wish to earn credit for your internship, consult with a USI Career Coordinator or your faculty advisor. Most academic departments offer program credit for internships and co-ops. If your major does not offer a built-in internship, you may be eligible to earn credit through GENS 399, a Field Experience through Career Services.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some key points about internships:\n",
      "- Internships can be part-time or full-time, typically lasting for a semester or during the summer.\n",
      "- Co-ops are structured differently, with students working full-time during one semester, taking a break from classes the next semester, and alternating between work and classes until graduation. Co-ops are less common than internships.\n",
      "- Most for-credit internships and co-ops require around 150 hours of professional work per semester for one to three credit hours.\n",
      "- Internship assignments may include goals, a journal, evaluations, and a final report.\n",

      "Internship Fees:\n",

      "Why Study Abroad:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Become more marketable: In an increasingly global marketplace, bilingualism and cultural understanding give a competitive advantage. Employers value qualities acquired through study abroad experiences such as boldness, flexibility, open-mindedness, confidence, character, and curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Study subjects in context: Gain a deeper understanding of art, literature, history, politics, and more by immersing yourself in the culture where these subjects originated. It brings the subjects to life and offers a new awareness of the world outside the U.S.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Meet interesting people: Connect with individuals from all over the world, practice languages, learn about different cultures, and expand your network. Many students form cross-cultural friendships that last a lifetime.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Learn about a culture: Living in a foreign culture provides insights and firsthand experiences that go beyond what can be learned from books or movies. Gain a new perspective and understanding of people and places.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Learn about the U.S.A: Comparing the customs and traditions of your host country to those of the U.S. will enhance your understanding of American culture and its diverse heritage.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Travel around the world: Study abroad opens doors to explore different countries. Traveling is usually easy and affordable, allowing you to experience various cultures and broaden your horizons.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Promote peace: By fostering connections and understanding between different cultures, study abroad contributes to global harmony and can make a positive impact on the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Find your calling: Study abroad can inspire and provide clarity for your future career or educational path. It offers the time and distance to reflect on your choices and may even lead to an international career.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Become a stronger person: Facing constant challenges in a foreign culture enhances your problem-solving skills, resilience, and adaptability. Navigating unfamiliar situations builds confidence and self-reliance.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Time-limited opportunity: College is a unique time to dedicate a significant amount of time to studying abroad. After graduation, responsibilities and commitments often make it difficult to pursue an extended international experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "11 Myths of Studying Abroad:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Too expensive: USI offers affordable study abroad programs, including the International Student Exchange Program (ISEP), which allows students to pay the same tuition, fees, and room and board as they do at USI. Scholarships specifically for study abroad are also available.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. A waste of time and money: Studying abroad provides valuable learning experiences, both inside and outside the classroom. The cultural immersion and international perspective gained during a study abroad program have long-term benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Financial aid does not transfer: Most forms of financial aid and scholarships apply to approved study abroad programs since students are billed through USI.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Need to speak a second language: Many study abroad programs are taught in English, eliminating the language barrier as a requirement for participation. There are programs available in English-speaking countries and non-English speaking countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Courses will not transfer: USI credits are awarded for coursework completed during a study abroad program. Proper planning and consultation with academic advisors ensure that courses count towards graduation requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Not possible to complete major requirements abroad: USI offers programs with major-specific courses that count towards degree requirements. Many students have successfully completed major requirements while studying abroad.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Study abroad will delay graduation: With proper planning and communication with advisors, it is possible to study abroad and graduate on time. Studying abroad can even put students ahead of schedule in some cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Better to go abroad after graduation: Post-graduation, it becomes challenging to find time and resources to study or travel abroad. College provides a unique opportunity to have an extended international experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Safer to stay in the U.S: Risks abroad are similar to those in the U.S., and USI closely monitors study abroad programs and locations to ensure student safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Does not help career: Employers value the skills gained through study abroad, such as adaptability, cultural competency, and communication. Studying abroad gives an edge in an increasingly global job market.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Difficult to get accepted: Most students who meet minimum requirements and complete the application process are accepted for study abroad programs. USI supports students throughout the process, helping them find the program that suits their needs and qualifications.\n",

      "5. Learn about the U.S.A: Comparing the customs and traditions of your host country to those of the U.S. will enhance your understanding of American culture and its diverse heritage.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Travel around the world: Study abroad opens doors to explore different countries. Traveling is usually easy and affordable, allowing you to experience various cultures and broaden your horizons.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Promote peace: By fostering connections and understanding between different cultures, study abroad contributes to global harmony and can make a positive impact on the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Find your calling: Study abroad can inspire and provide clarity for your future career or educational path. It offers the time and distance to reflect on your choices and may even lead to an international career.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Become a stronger person: Facing constant challenges in a foreign culture enhances your problem-solving skills, resilience, and adaptability. Navigating unfamiliar situations builds confidence and self-reliance.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Time-limited opportunity: College is a unique time to dedicate a significant amount of time to studying abroad. After graduation, responsibilities and commitments often make it difficult to pursue an extended international experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "11 Myths of Studying Abroad:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Too expensive: USI offers affordable study abroad programs, including the International Student Exchange Program (ISEP), which allows students to pay the same tuition, fees, and room and board as they do at USI. Scholarships specifically for study abroad are also available.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. A waste of time and money: Studying abroad provides valuable learning experiences, both inside and outside the classroom. The cultural immersion and international perspective gained during a study abroad program have long-term benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Financial aid does not transfer: Most forms of financial aid and scholarships apply to approved study abroad programs since students are billed through USI.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Need to speak a second language: Many study abroad programs are taught in English, eliminating the language barrier as a requirement for participation. There are programs available in English-speaking countries and non-English speaking countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Courses will not transfer: USI credits are awarded for coursework completed during a study abroad program. Proper planning and consultation with academic advisors ensure that courses count towards graduation requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Not possible to complete major requirements abroad: USI offers programs with major-specific courses that count towards degree requirements. Many students have successfully completed major requirements while studying abroad.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Study abroad will delay graduation: With proper planning and communication with advisors, it is possible to study abroad and graduate on time. Studying abroad can even put students ahead of schedule in some cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Better to go abroad after graduation: Post-graduation, it becomes challenging to find time and resources to study or travel abroad. College provides a unique opportunity to have an extended international experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Safer to stay in the U.S: Risks abroad are similar to those in the U.S., and USI closely monitors study abroad programs and locations to ensure student safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Does not help career: Employers value the skills gained through study abroad, such as adaptability, cultural competency, and communication. Studying abroad gives an edge in an increasingly global job market.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Difficult to get accepted: Most students who meet minimum requirements and complete the application process are accepted for study abroad programs. USI supports students throughout the process, helping them find the program that suits their needs and qualifications.\n",

      "Credit Cards: Credit cards are useful for larger purchases, emergencies, and cash advances.

      "Wire Transfers and Drafts: Western Union is a reliable option for international money transfers. Ensure that the recipient's information matches the passport exactly. Additional fees may apply.\n",

      "What is the College Achievement Program?\n",
      "\n",
      "- CAP offers high school juniors and seniors the opportunity to earn college credits by enrolling in USI courses taught in the high school by approved instructors.\n",
      "- Students receive both USI and high school credit for participating in the designated CAP courses.\n",
      "- CAP courses are real USI courses and require effort and academic commitment.\n",
      "- Students should consult with their CAP instructor, counselor, and parents before enrolling in CAP to determine if it is the right fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Student Qualifications & Prerequisites:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Students should have a minimum cumulative high school GPA of 2.5 on a 4.0 scale.\n",
      "- Junior or senior status required.\n",
      "- Students must have a GPA above 2.5 and meet additional criteria for specific courses.\n",
      "- Past-due balances exceeding $250 from previous semesters will impact the eligibility to enroll in CAP.\n",
      "- Students with disabilities who meet the eligibility standards are encouraged to enroll in CAP and should work with their high school's special education service provider to review and modify accommodations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Registration Procedures:\n",
      "\n",
      "- High schools on the semester system should commit to year-long or fall-only CAP courses during fall registration.\n",
      "- High school courses that meet only in the spring will have a spring registration.\n",
      "- Deadlines vary for high schools on trimester or quarter systems and will be communicated by the CAP instructor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Benefits of Being a CAP Student:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Access to USI's advising centers to determine how CAP courses fit into future degree plans.\n",
      "- Access to myUSI, the online student portal, to view grades, access unofficial transcripts, request official USI transcripts, and access the USI student email account.\n",
      "- Privileges at the Rice Library, including borrowing materials, using study rooms, and accessing databases for research.\n",
      "- Access to academic tutoring services provided by USI's Academic Skills Office.\n",
      "\n",
      "Transferability of CAP Credits:\n",
      "\n",
      "- While USI credits earned through CAP generally transfer well to other colleges and universities, it is important to investigate transferability with the specific institutions of interest.\n",
      "- Public colleges and universities within Indiana participate in the Indiana Core Transfer Library (CTL) to facilitate credit transfer among institutions.\n",
      "- The USI CAP courses included in the CTL can be found on the USI website.\n",
      "- Transferability of CAP credits to out-of-state and private institutions will vary and should be examined on an individual basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early Graduation Policy:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Students planning to complete high school one semester early may enroll in a fall-only CAP course, but year-long CAP courses should not be taken as enrollment will not be permitted for the spring semester.\n",
      "\n",
      "Withdrawals:\n",
      "\n",
      "- CAP students must follow the Withdrawal Calendar, which is an adjusted version of the USI Academic Calendar.\n",
      "- Dropping the high school CAP course does not automatically remove students from the USI CAP section.\n",
      "\n",
      "Undergraduate Admission to USI:\n",
      "\n",
      "- CAP participation does not guarantee undergraduate admission to USI.\n",
      "- Students planning to attend USI after high school graduation must complete the USI Application for Undergraduate Admission.\n",
      "\n",
      "Core 39 (USI's General Education Curriculum):\n",
      "\n",
      "- USI students are required to complete the Core 39 general education curriculum as part of their bachelor's degree.\n",
      "- More information about Core 39 can be found on the USI website.\n",
      "\n",
      "FERPA Regulations:\n",
      "\n",
      "- FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) protects the privacy of student education records.\n",
      "- Certain information, known as \"Directory Information,\" may be released without the student's written permission.\n",
      "- Students who did not waive their FERPA rights can fill out a disclosure form to specify what information can be shared and with whom.\n",
      "- FERPA permits disclosure of educational information to parents if they provide tax records proving the student is their dependent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Procedures for CAP World Language Courses:\n",
      "\n",
      "- CAP offers dual credit world language courses where students can earn 12 credit hours toward college graduation, including 6 credit hours applicable to a language major or minor at USI.\n",
      "- Specific procedures are followed for world language CAP courses, and successful completion of certain levels can result in departmental credit or seat time credit.\n",
      "- Transferability of departmental credits may vary, and students should discuss their plans with their intended college or university.\n",
      "\n",
      "For more information and specific details, students can contact the CAP staff or visit the USI website.\n",

      "University of Southern Indiana (USI) College Achievement Program (CAP)\n",
      "\n",
      "CAP Staff:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Jaclyn Dumond, Director, CAP and Lifelong Learning\n",
      "- Dana Drury, Manager, CAP\n",
      "- Zoe Meuth, CAP Program Associate\n",
      "\n",
      "Division of Outreach & Engagement, University of Southern Indiana (USI)\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the College Achievement Program?\n",
      "\n",
      "- CAP offers high school juniors and seniors the opportunity to earn college credits by enrolling in USI courses taught in the high school by approved instructors.\n",
      "- Students receive both USI and high school credit for participating in the designated CAP courses.\n",
      "- CAP courses are real USI courses and require effort and academic commitment.\n",
      "- Students should consult with their CAP instructor, counselor, and parents before enrolling in CAP to determine if it is the right fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Student Qualifications & Prerequisites:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Students should have a minimum cumulative high school GPA of 2.5 on a 4.0 scale.\n",
      "- Junior or senior status required.\n",
      "- Students must have a GPA above 2.5 and meet additional criteria for specific courses.\n",
      "- Past-due balances exceeding $250 from previous semesters will impact the eligibility to enroll in CAP.\n",
      "- Students with disabilities who meet the eligibility standards are encouraged to enroll in CAP and should work with their high school's special education service provider to review and modify accommodations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Registration Procedures:\n",
      "\n",
      "- High schools on the semester system should commit to year-long or fall-only CAP courses during fall registration.\n",
      "- High school courses that meet only in the spring will have a spring registration.\n",
      "- Deadlines vary for high schools on trimester or quarter systems and will be communicated by the CAP instructor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Benefits of Being a CAP Student:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Access to USI's advising centers to determine how CAP courses fit into future degree plans.\n",
      "- Access to myUSI, the online student portal, to view grades, access unofficial transcripts, request official USI transcripts, and access the USI student email account.\n",
      "- Privileges at the Rice Library, including borrowing materials, using study rooms, and accessing databases for research.\n",
      "- Access to academic tutoring services provided by USI's Academic Skills Office.\n",
      "\n",
      "Transferability of CAP Credits:\n",
      "\n",
      "- While USI credits earned through CAP generally transfer well to other colleges and universities, it is important to investigate transferability with the specific institutions of interest.\n",
      "- Public colleges and universities within Indiana participate in the Indiana Core Transfer Library (CTL) to facilitate credit transfer among institutions.\n",
      "- The USI CAP courses included in the CTL can be found on the USI website.\n",
      "- Transferability of CAP credits to out-of-state and private institutions will vary and should be examined on an individual basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early Graduation Policy:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Students planning to complete high school one semester early may enroll in a fall-only CAP course, but year-long CAP courses should not be taken as enrollment will not be permitted for the spring semester.\n",
      "\n",
      "Withdrawals:\n",
      "\n",
      "- CAP students must follow the Withdrawal Calendar, which is an adjusted version of the USI Academic Calendar.\n",
      "- Dropping the high school CAP course does not automatically remove students from the USI CAP section.\n",
      "\n",
      "Undergraduate Admission to USI:\n",
      "\n",
      "- CAP participation does not guarantee undergraduate admission to USI.\n",
      "- Students planning to attend USI after high school graduation must complete the USI Application for Undergraduate Admission.\n",
      "\n",
      "Core 39 (USI's General Education Curriculum):\n",
      "\n",
      "- USI students are required to complete the Core 39 general education curriculum as part of their bachelor's degree.\n",
      "- More information about Core 39 can be found on the USI website.\n",
      "\n",
      "FERPA Regulations:\n",
      "\n",
      "- FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) protects the privacy of student education records.\n",
      "- Certain information, known as \"Directory Information,\" may be released without the student's written permission.\n",
      "- Students who did not waive their FERPA rights can fill out a disclosure form to specify what information can be shared and with whom.\n",
      "- FERPA permits disclosure of educational information to parents if they provide tax records proving the student is their dependent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Procedures for CAP World Language Courses:\n",
      "\n",
      "- CAP offers dual credit world language courses where students can earn 12 credit hours toward college graduation, including 6 credit hours applicable to a language major or minor at USI.\n",
      "- Specific procedures are followed for world language CAP courses, and successful completion of certain levels can result in departmental credit or seat time credit.\n",
      "- Transferability of departmental credits may vary, and students should discuss their plans with their intended college or university.\n",
      "\n",
      "For more information and specific details, students can contact the CAP staff or visit the USI website.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. Time Allowed: The faculty will communicate the time allowed for each test.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Exam Format: Students will complete course exams in person, on campus, or via Proctorio. Students will need to bring a laptop or tablet to complete online exams in the designated USI classroom. Taking exams remotely without faculty approval and proctoring is not permitted and violates the University's Academic Integrity and Appeal Policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Electronic Devices: Students are not allowed to have any electronic storage devices during an exam or test review, except for the device they are using to complete an online exam. This includes cell phones, iPads, advanced capability watches, activity trackers, etc. Simple wristwatches are allowed during testing.

      "\n",
      "9. Computerized Exams: Computerized exams are arranged by the course faculty. Unless otherwise designated, all online/computerized exams are closed-book and reflect only individual effort. Downloading or reproducing any exam or part of an exam is considered academic dishonesty.\n",

      "Professional Standards & Behavior in the University of Southern Indiana (USI) School of Nursing\n",
      "\n",
      "The USI School of Nursing upholds high standards of conduct and professionalism among students, staff, and faculty. The ANA Code of Ethics serves as a guide to define expected conduct and behavior for nursing professionals. The School of Nursing also follows state Nurse Practice Acts, university policies and guidelines, and the Student Rights and Responsibilities outlined in the Bulletin and USI Nursing Handbooks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Concepts and Guiding Principles for Professional Behavior:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Caring: Nurses demonstrate empathetic concern for others through active listening, appropriate touch, and holistic assessment of individuals. Nurses must also care for themselves and engage in activities that promote a healthy lifestyle.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Tolerance and Respect: Nurses accept others regardless of age, race, gender, ethnicity, appearance, personal beliefs, political beliefs, religious beliefs, or sexual orientation. Respect is essential in recognizing the uniqueness of each individual.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Advocacy: Nurses support and protect the rights and safety of clients, families, peers, colleagues, groups, and communities. Advocacy involves speaking for those unable to express their wishes and respecting autonomy.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Accountability and Responsibility: Nurses are accountable and responsible for their actions and decisions in providing nursing care. They uphold standards of practice and take responsibility for their own words and written communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Integrity: Nurses adhere to a code of behavior, maintaining honesty, trust, respect, high ethical standards, and moral character. Integrity is expected in the learning environment, and cheating, plagiarizing, or facilitating such activities are unacceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Decision Making and Delegation: Nurses make decisions based on the nursing process, respecting the unique needs and values of each client, group, or community. Delegation involves transferring responsibilities within the scope of practice for the interprofessional team.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Competence: Nurses apply knowledge, skills, and judgment expected for their practice role, ensuring public health, safety, and welfare. Nurses are individually responsible for maintaining competence and engaging in professional growth and development.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Professional Development and Growth: Nurses seek learning opportunities and engage in scholarship to keep up with the evolving practice of nursing. Continuous learning is essential for providing safe and effective care.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Confidentiality: Nurses protect the privacy of client information and maintain confidentiality. Sharing client information requires the client's permission and informed consent, unless required by law. Discussions of client information outside the appropriate learning environment are strictly prohibited.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Communication: Nurses effectively communicate and share information with clients, families, peers, colleagues, and the community. Verbal and nonverbal communication skills, including active listening, are crucial for providing compassionate care.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Ethics: Nurses make decisions based on moral philosophy, utilizing the ANA Code of Ethics. Personal values should not supersede professional ethical guidelines when functioning in the nursing role.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. Legal Principles: Nurses are responsible, accountable, and personally liable for their actions, abiding by legal guidelines. They have an obligation to provide safe and competent care, fulfill contractual obligations, and protect recipients' rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. Professionalism: Nurses present themselves professionally at all times, maintaining professional behavior, appearance, and interactions. This applies when representing oneself as a nursing professional in any capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The USI School of Nursing expects students, staff, and faculty to adhere to these professional standards and behavior guidelines. Violations of ethical behavior, including cheating, plagiarizing, or inappropriate conduct, will not be tolerated.\n",
