Electrical Engineering

- Prepare for a profession in the design and development of electrical circuits, power and control systems, electronic components, computer architecture, and embedded software.
- Education makes you employable in virtually any industry, as all rely on electronics and electrical systems.
- Median annual pay for electrical and electronics engineers is $99,070 (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2018).

Faculty and Education

- Faculty focus on helping you reach your goals.
- Professors, not graduate students, instruct in the classroom and laboratory.
- Many faculty have years of industry experience, providing practical insights alongside theory.
- Class sizes are typically 24 students and smaller as students advance.
- Student-faculty ratio is 16:1, and instructors maintain an open-door policy for consultations.
- Meet the engineering faculty.

Engineering Electronics for NASA

- USI's College of Engineering won funding in 2016 for an engineering challenge from NASA.
- The challenge was to design, test, deploy, and monitor a satellite called UNITE CubeSat.
- A team of engineering students developed UNITE over about 30 months, meeting NASA criteria of over 100 hardware and systems tests.
- UNITE was launched into orbit from the International Space Station in January 2019 and continues to relay information until its mission ends.
- This project is one example of the extracurricular practical experiences available in engineering at USI.
- Learn more about these opportunities.
