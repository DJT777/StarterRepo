Steps to Study Abroad

    Considerations:
        Why do I want to study abroad, and what do I hope to gain from such an experience?
        What goals do I hope to attain from my experience abroad? (e.g., mastering a language, pursuing a specific hobby or area of interest)
        What skills do I already have, and how developed are they?
        What countries, regions, climates, etc. would I be comfortable living in, and where would I definitely be unwilling to go?
        When would be the ideal time to go? How long would I like to stay?
        Living situation preferences (on my own, homestay, with other American students, with native/local students)
        Total immersion in a culture or preference for having other exchange students around?
        Willingness to accept possible loneliness of going overseas without a built-in network
        Financial limitations to consider
        Time availability in academic schedule to go abroad
        Importance of staying on a four-year schedule
        Preference for classes in English or another language
