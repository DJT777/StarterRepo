A Dual Credit Opportunity

    CAP is a cooperative program between the University of Southern Indiana (USI) and participating high schools.
    CAP allows highly motivated high school students to take regular college courses in their own high schools at no cost.
    CAP courses are taught by high school instructors who meet USI's credentialing expectations and are trained and supported by USI faculty liaisons.
    CAP courses follow the same curriculum and academic standards as on-campus sections.

Accreditation

    CAP has been accredited by the National Alliance of Concurrent Enrollment Partnerships (NACEP) since 2006.
