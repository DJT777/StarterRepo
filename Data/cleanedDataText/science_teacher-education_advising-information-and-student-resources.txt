Pott College of Science, Engineering, and Education Advising Information

Students are advised throughout their time at the University by full-time teacher education faculty. These faculty members are available to discuss goals, career alternatives, and progress during the academic year. Close collaboration between students and advisors contributes to their success.

First-year students, transfer students preparing to be admitted to their major, and Pott College students seeking academic and career advising can seek assistance from the Student Advising and Resource Center.

Secondary Education students should contact Mrs. Michelle Herrmann in the Teacher Education department to be assigned a secondary education advisor.

Clinical Practice and Internship:

Clinical Practice is the final semester of all teaching degree programs at the University of Southern Indiana. During this semester, teacher candidates fully immerse themselves in the daily work of teaching. USI has Clinical Education Agreements with school corporations in Indiana and southern Illinois within a 60-mile radius of Evansville. Clinical interns are placed with cooperating teachers in partner schools for a full-time, 16-week experience. The internship is completed in the major area of study, and all candidates must meet specific requirements before starting the internship.

Co-Teaching:

The Co-Teaching Model is used by clinical interns and cooperating teachers during the clinical internship semester. Co-Teaching involves two teachers sharing the planning, organization, delivery, and assessment of instruction, as well as the physical space in the classroom.
