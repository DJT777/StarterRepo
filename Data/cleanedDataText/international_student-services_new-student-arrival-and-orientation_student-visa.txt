    Visa Process

        After receiving an I-20 or DS-2019 from USI, students need to obtain an F-1 student visa or a J-1 exchange visitor visa to attend USI.

        Steps involved in the visa process:

            Complete the online Nonimmigrant Visa Application (Form DS-160).
            Pay the I-901 SEVIS fee.
            Gather required documentation as instructed by the American embassy.
                Suggested documentation includes: visa application forms, passport, photograph, visa application fee receipt, I-20 or DS-2019, I-901 SEVIS fee payment receipt, acceptance letter from USI, evidence of financial documentation, and evidence of ties to the home country.
            Prepare for the visa interview by reviewing the 10 Points to Remember When Applying for a Student Visa.
            Remain calm and answer all questions openly and honestly during the interview.

        For further assistance with the application process and information on studying in the U.S., students can contact an educational advisor at an advising center in their country.
