Hazardous Spills and Odors

Emergency Procedures:

- Exit the Area: If a hazardous chemical is spilled, immediately exit the area. If the spill occurred in a laboratory and the fume hood is accessible, raise the sash for increased airflow.
- Secure the Area: Close the doors to the area with the spill and secure the area, if possible. Most laboratories are under negative pressure to prevent hazardous vapors from spreading.
- Call Public Safety: Contact USI Public Safety at 812-492-7777 or ext. 7777 from a safe location, providing information such as building name, room number, type of incident, and chemical spilled or description of odor.
- Assess the Situation: Determine if the spill is Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health (IDLH). If not, wait outside the laboratory for the spill response team. If IDLH, proceed to the next step.
- Pull the Fire Alarm: If the spill poses an immediate danger, activate the fire alarm to evacuate the building and notify the local fire department.
- Exit the Building: Once the fire alarm is activated, leave the building and stay at a safe distance from the entrance. Provide complete information to emergency response teams upon arrival.

Chemical Contamination:

- Remove Contaminated Clothing: Immediately remove any contaminated clothing and flush all bodily contact areas with water.
- Seek Medical Assistance: Obtain medical attention for injured or exposed individuals. Rinse contact areas with water for at least 15 minutes, unless directed otherwise by medical personnel.
- Visit Health Services: Go to campus Health Services or a local hospital for medical care and evaluation. Bring applicable Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) if available.

Radiation Release:

- Restrict Access: Ask non-contaminated persons in the immediate area to leave and establish a restricted area for authorized personnel only.
- Maintain Surveillance: Keep the restricted area under constant supervision by an Authorized User or the Radiation Safety Officer until it is deemed safe for occupancy.
- Notify: Inform the Authorized User directly responsible for the radioactive material involved in the incident.
- Follow Procedures: Assess the accident to determine if it is minor or major and follow the appropriate procedures outlined in the Radiation Safety Training Guide.

Biological Spills:

- Report all spills of biological materials to the Environmental Health & Safety Manager, regardless of biosafety level.
- Extremely large spills should also be reported to Public Safety.
- If the spill poses an inhalation hazard, do not attempt to handle it. Let Environmental Health and Safety handle the situation.

Gas Leaks or Releases:

- Notify Building Occupants: Immediately evacuate the area and notify building occupants to evacuate using general evacuation procedures.
- Contact Public Safety: Call Public Safety and provide the building name, floor and room number, specific chemical name of the involved gas, and source of the gas.

Unusual or Abnormal Odors:

- Potentially Hazardous Odors: If the source of the odor is potentially hazardous (e.g., natural gas), contact Public Safety immediately.
- Rotten Egg or Sewer Odors: Run water down nearby sinks to refill drain traps and check if the odor dissipates. If the odor persists, report it to Facility Operations and Planning.
- Fishy or Musty Odors: These odors may indicate leaks in the steam system. Report them to Environmental Health and Safety.
- Exhaust or Diesel Odors: These odors may enter the building through air intakes. If they persist, contact USI Environmental Health and Safety.
- Unknown Odors: Report any unknown odors to Environmental Health and Safety.
