    Formative Assessment of Classroom Teaching (FACT and eFACT) Program:

        - Goal: To assist instructors in reflective teaching by providing mid-semester feedback from students.
        - How to Request a FACT:
            - Any faculty member can request a FACT or eFACT by completing a request form.
            - Effective use of the feedback involves reflection and self-assessment, not evaluation.
        - When to Schedule a FACT:
            - Mid-semester (recommended during weeks 4-7)
            - After students have received at least one grade item
            - Enough time left in the semester for potential changes in teaching approaches
            - Suggestions for choosing which course to request a FACT for can be discussed with CETL staff.
        - What Happens in a FACT:
            - Trained FACT Consultant visits the class during the last 20 minutes.
            - Instructor is not present.
            - Students reflect on their learning experiences and provide suggestions for improvement.
            - Consultant and students discuss the responses and better understand the learning process.
        - FACT Consultants:
            - Provide the service to the USI community.
            - Receive training to facilitate the FACT process.
            - Adhere to confidentiality guidelines.
