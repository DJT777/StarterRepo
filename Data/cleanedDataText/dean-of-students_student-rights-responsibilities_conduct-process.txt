University of Southern Indiana (USI) Student Rights and Responsibilities: A Code of Student Behavior

Section 7: Conduct Process

Overview of the Conduct Process:

- The campus conduct process is flexible and may vary in severity and complexity depending on the situation.
- All campus conduct proceedings commence with notice of a potential violation of University rules.
- The process and applicable timelines begin with the notice of a potential violation.

Purpose:

- The purpose of the complaint resolution procedures is to provide education and personal growth opportunities for students, ensure fair inquiries into alleged violations, and determine appropriate conflict resolutions.
- The focus is on determining whether a student is responsible for the alleged violations.

Student Rights and Due Process in the Conduct Process:

- A student is considered responsible for violations if they admit to the violation or are found responsible for one or more provisions of the Student Rights and Responsibilities.
- Students and complainants have the right to present information and ask questions during the complaint resolution proceedings.
- The standard of proof is "more likely than not" that a violation has occurred.

University Advisor:

- Both the student and complainant have the right to an advisor from the University community.
- The advisor's role is to provide support and assistance in preparing for the hearing.

Witnesses:

- Witnesses, including the accused student, are permitted in all complaint resolution proceedings.
- Witnesses may be questioned by the conduct officer, hearing board members, the complainant, and the student.
- Witness statements may be submitted if witnesses are unable to be present at the hearing.

Conduct Process Environment:

- Hearings are closed to the public, and only individuals directly involved in the situation may be present.

Initiation, Investigation, and Disposition of Complaints:

- Alleged violations of University policy should be reported as soon as possible.
- Reports can be filed with USI Public Safety, USI Housing and Residence Life, or the USI Dean of Students Office.
- Any member of the University community may report a violation.

Notification:

- The charged student is typically notified within ten working days of receiving the complaint.
- The notification includes details of the alleged violation, hearing information, applicable sanctions, information on record preservation and release, and the possibility of decision-making in the student's absence.

Conduct Process Options:

- Administrative Hearing: Conducted by an administrative hearing officer.
- University Hearing Board: Comprised of students, faculty, and administrators.
- Cases involving potential suspension or expulsion may require a hearing before the University Hearing Board or a pre-hearing for review.

Sanctions, Restrictions, and Stipulations:

- Sanctions are consequences imposed on a student found responsible for a violation.
- Restrictions and stipulations may be additional actions taken in conjunction with sanctions.
- Possible sanctions include warnings, probation, deferred suspension, emergency suspension, suspension, and expulsion.
- Educational requirements, community/service, restitution, confiscation, restriction of access/removal from University housing, loss of privileges, and participation in specific programs may also be imposed.

Appeals:

- Students found responsible may appeal the decision within two business days of receiving the hearing record notification.
- Appeals must be based on specific grounds, such as violation of rights, arbitrary decision, new evidence, or inconsistency with University standards.
- Appeals are reviewed by the Dean of Students or their designee.

Student Behavior Records:

- Conduct records are considered educational records and are confidential.
- Record retention varies depending on the severity of violations, ranging from a minimum of seven years to permanent records.
- Records related to violations resulting in suspension or expulsion are considered permanent records.
- Student organizations' records are retained as long as the organization maintains its official recognition status with USI.

This Code of Student Behavior was implemented on August 15, 2023.
