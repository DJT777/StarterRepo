Nurturing Our Nest - Administrative Senate

Initiative:
- "Nurturing Our Nest" is a grassroots effort by the Administrative Senate to provide tips for recruiting and retaining students at USI.

Free Pennant:
- Administrative Senate created a printable pennant to share with USI Friends and Family.
- The pennant can be downloaded as a PDF and printed.

Tips for Recruitment and Retention:
1. Wear USI Apparel:
   - Wearing USI apparel can spark conversations with prospective students even when away from campus.
   - If you see someone else wearing USI apparel, engage in a friendly conversation.

2. Go Above and Beyond:
   - If a student is lost or in the wrong office, walk them to the appropriate office for assistance.
   - This helps new or continuing students and makes the process seamless for everyone.

3. Helpfully Transfer Calls:
   - If a call is received in your office that should be handled by another office, provide a "soft hand-off."
   - Transfer the call by supplying the caller's name, number, and concern to the appropriate office.
   - This avoids the need for the caller to explain everything again.

4. Donate to Food Closet:
   - Archie's Food Closet is a service for the USI community to promote health and wellness.
   - Donations can be dropped off at the RFWC Information Desk.

5. Share USI's Successes:
   - Share achievements, faculty work, and USI happenings on personal social media accounts.
   - Help increase visibility and celebrate the accomplishments of USI students.

6. Be a Representative:
   - Nominate yourself or a colleague for service on Administrative Senate, Staff Council, or Faculty Senate.
   - Representing colleagues and being their voice contributes to making USI a better place to work.

7. Surprise and Delight:
   - Surprise and delight coworkers and student workers with treats or notes of appreciation for their work.

8. Celebrate Graduates:
   - With Commencement approaching, reach out to congratulate USI's newest alumni on their achievements.
