APPENDIX A

1. Package Monitoring:

   - Packages will be monitored for surface contamination and external radiation levels.
   - Monitoring will be done within 3 hours after receipt during working hours or within 18 hours if received after working hours.
   - Shipments of liquids greater than exempt quantities will be tested for leakage.
   - Action limits for package monitoring are as follows:

     - Radioactive Material Packages:
       - "Radioactive-White I" label:
         - Dose rate limit on accessible surface of package: 0.5 mR/hr
         - Dose rate limit at three feet from external surface of package: 0 mR/hr

       - "Radioactive-Yellow II" label:
         - Dose rate limit on accessible surface of package: 50 mR/hr
         - Dose rate limit at three feet from external surface of package: 1.0 mR/hr

       - "Radioactive-Yellow III" label:
         - Dose rate limit on accessible surface of package: 200 mR/hr
         - Dose rate limit at three feet from external surface of package: 10 mR/hr

2. Opening Packages:

   - Put on gloves to prevent hand contamination.
   - Visually inspect package for any sign of damage (e.g., wetness, crushed).
     - If damage is noted, stop the procedure and notify the Radiation Safety Officer (RSO).
   - Open the package following these steps:

     1) Open the outer package (follow manufacturer's directions, if provided) and remove the packing slip.
     2) Open the inner package and verify that the contents match those on the packing slip.
        - Compare the requisition, packing slip, and label on the bottle.
     3) Check the integrity of the final source container.
        - Inspect for breakage of seals or vials, loss of liquid, and discoloration of packaging material.
     4) Check that the shipment does not exceed possession limits.
   - Monitor the packing material and packages for contamination before discarding.
     - If contaminated, treat as radioactive waste.
     - If not contaminated, obliterate radiation labels before discarding in regular trash.

3. Record Keeping:

   - Maintain records of the results of checking each package using the "Radioactive Shipment Receipt/Usage Report."
