Adapting to a New Culture

Culture Shock:

    Definition: The term "culture shock" was introduced in 1958 to describe the anxiety experienced when moving to a completely new environment.
    Symptoms: Feeling lost or unsure of what to do, not knowing what is appropriate or inappropriate in the new culture.
    Timing: Culture shock typically sets in after the first few weeks of living in a new place.
    Discomfort: Physical and emotional discomfort due to the differences in language, customs, and everyday practices.
    Opportunity for Growth: Culture shock provides an opportunity for personal development, learning, and gaining new perspectives.

Tips to Survive Culture Shock:

    Be objective and avoid judgment.
    Recognize your own biases and be open to new experiences.
    Embrace the situation and explore it rather than withdrawing.
    Take the time to get to know the local people and culture.
    Remember that you are a visitor and there to learn, not change the host culture.
    Prepare in advance by learning about the country you will be visiting, including its political structure, geography, history, religion, and social structure.

Culture Shock Pattern:

    Initial Excitement: Everything is new, interesting, and exciting.
    Frustration: Differences become apparent and may be irritating, leading to problems and frustration.
    Homesickness: Feelings of homesickness, depression, and helplessness may arise.
    Coping and Adaptation: Strategies are developed to cope with difficulties and adapt to the host culture.
    Acceptance: Cultural differences are accepted and embraced, with the host culture becoming a new home.
    Excitement about Returning: Anticipation of returning home, but also potential frustration, anger, or loneliness upon realizing that friends and family may not fully understand the experiences and changes.
    Adjustment at Home: Gradual adjustment to life at home, incorporating what was learned and experienced abroad into the new life and career.

Returning Home:

    Re-entry Culture Shock: Upon returning to the United States, the process of culture shock may repeat itself.
    Seeking Support: Surround yourself with supportive friends and family who understand and can help you through any challenges.
    Incorporating Experiences: Integrate what you learned and experienced abroad into your new life and career.
