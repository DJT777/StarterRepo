Academic Integrity at the University of Southern Indiana

Academic Integrity Statement:

The University of Southern Indiana (USI) is committed to creating a culture of civility and academic integrity. Academic integrity is crucial to the mission and culture of the campus. The academic integrity statement serves as an educational tool, defining academic integrity, outlining violations and sanctions, and administering the academic integrity policy.

Definition of Academic Integrity:

Academic integrity at USI involves demonstrating respect for all students' right to a safe and quality learning environment, promoting professional and ethical behavior, appropriately citing others' work, and prohibiting unapproved assistance in academic endeavors. It ensures fairness to all students, maintains academic honor, and upholds the credibility of the institution.

Violations of Academic Integrity:

USI classifies violations of academic integrity into different levels based on the severity of the offense, including cheating, interference, fabrication, plagiarism, academic sabotage, facilitating academic dishonesty, violation of research or professional ethics, and violations involving potentially criminal activity.

Sanctions:

The severity of the offense determines the appropriate sanctions, which may include failing the assignment, failing the class, dismissal from the program, academic probation, or expulsion from the institution.

Appeals Process:

Students found responsible for a violation of academic integrity have the right to appeal the decision. An appeal must be made in writing within two business days of receiving the notification. Appeals are reviewed by the Dean of the academic college where the violation occurred, and if necessary, further appealed to the Provost's Office.

Approval and Implementation:

This Student Rights and Responsibilities policy, including the Academic Integrity section, was approved on August 14, 2023, by Dean Laurie Berry and implemented on August 15, 2023.

Contact Information:

Students can contact the Dean of Students Office for more information or to initiate the appeals process. Contact details are available on the USI website.
