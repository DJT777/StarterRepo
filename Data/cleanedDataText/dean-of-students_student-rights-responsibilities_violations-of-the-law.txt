Student Rights and Responsibilities: A Code of Student Behavior

4.0 Violations of the Law

    Alleged violations of federal, state, and local laws may be investigated and addressed under the Code of Student Conduct.
    The University of Southern Indiana has jurisdiction over offenses that occur on its campus.
    The University reserves the right to exercise emergency suspension if a student is facing criminal investigation and/or complaint.
    Emergency suspensions are imposed until a hearing can be held, typically within two weeks.
    Suspended students may request an immediate hearing from the Dean of Students to show cause for lifting the emergency suspension.
    The emergency suspension may be continued if there is a danger to the community and if the University is delayed in conducting its own investigation.
    The University will only delay its hearing until it can conduct an internal investigation or obtain sufficient information to proceed.
    
This Student Rights and Responsibilities code was approved on August 14, 2023, by Dean Laurie Berry and implemented on August 15, 2023.
