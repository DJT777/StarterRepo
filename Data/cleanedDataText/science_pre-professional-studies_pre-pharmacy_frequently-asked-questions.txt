Frequently Asked Questions:

1. What major should I select for Pre-Pharmacy?
- Pre-Pharmacy is not a specific major, and there is no required major for Pharmacy School. Many students choose majors in science fields such as biology, chemistry, or math, but it is not necessary. However, it is advised to declare a major just in case.

2. What classes do I need to take for Pre-Pharmacy?
- The specific prerequisite course requirements vary among Pharmacy schools. It is crucial to identify the schools you are interested in to determine the required courses. For example, Purdue School of Pharmacy requires courses in biology, chemistry, organic chemistry, physics, microbiology, biochemistry, immunology or cell biology or genetics, anatomy and physiology, calculus, statistics, English, economics, and speech.

3. Do I need a 4.0 GPA for Pre-Pharmacy?
- While a high GPA is beneficial, having a 4.0 GPA is not necessary. It is recommended to aim for a solid GPA in the 3.80-4.00 range (on a 4-point scale) and demonstrate interests beyond academics through extracurricular activities. Most programs require a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.00 for application, but a competitive GPA is typically around 3.5.

4. How do I apply for Pharmacy School?
- Pharmacy Schools do not require a bachelor's degree, so some students start the application process in their sophomore or junior year of undergraduate studies. The application process is managed by PharmCAS (Pharmacy College Application Service), which is hosted by the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP). PharmCAS handles the online application, transcript submissions, and letters of recommendation.

5. What is the PCAT (Pharmacy College Admission Test)?
- The PCAT is a standardized exam that is required by some Pharmacy Schools. It is a computer-based test that assesses proficiency in writing, biological processes, chemical processes, critical reading, and quantitative reasoning. It is best taken in the spring prior to application, and it is generally recommended to study for 6-12 months.

6. Do I need shadowing experience for Pre-Pharmacy?
- Shadowing experiences are valuable in pre-pharmacy training. The requirements for shadowing vary among Pharmacy schools. Many students gain experience by working as a pharmacy technician. Shadowing different types of pharmacists (e.g., retail versus hospital) broadens the experience. Volunteer activities or summer work related to pharmacy can also provide insight into the profession.

Tips to Remember:

- Ensure accuracy of information entered in the PharmCAS application.
- Request transcripts from all academic institutions in advance.
- Craft a strong personal statement to distinguish yourself.
- Start the application process early, as many schools have rolling admission policies.
- Choose letter of recommendation writers carefully and provide them with a resume or CV.
- Familiarize yourself with the specific requirements of the pharmacy schools you plan to apply to.
- Seek a balanced life with involvement in extracurricular activities.
