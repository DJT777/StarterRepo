    Purpose: The CARE Team at the University of Southern Indiana (USI) is a cross-functional assessment group chaired by the Dean of Students. It is dedicated to responding to students in apparent or potential distress. CARE stands for Campus Action Response and Engagement. The team's mission is to provide proactive assistance, support, and resources to students who may be experiencing difficulties adjusting to the university community or require additional support to succeed.

    Reporting Concerns: The team encourages students, faculty, staff, and parents to report concerning behavior or students who appear to be troubled. Reports can be submitted through the online CARE Team Reporting Form or by contacting the Dean of Students Office. Reports should include incidents of concerning, aberrant, dangerous, or threatening behavior.

    Goals of the CARE Team:

        Review information received regarding concerning student behavior and determine an appropriate response.
        Intervene early and provide support to students with disruptive, disturbed, or distressed behaviors.
        Serve as a central resource and information gathering source.
        Coordinate follow-up services, support, and resources effectively.
        Utilize a formalized protocol for communication, coordination, and intervention.
        Bridge student privacy laws and the university's need for information to ensure a healthy environment for all students.
        Coordinate university follow-up and support for students experiencing mental health and medical challenges, going through conduct processes, needing disability resources, and requiring assistance with university processes and policies.
