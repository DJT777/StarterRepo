Undergraduate 

    Applicant: University of Southern Indiana
    Address: 8600 University Boulevard, Evansville, IN 47712
    Radioactive Material:
        - Hydrogen 3 (Any form, Maximum amount requested: 20 millicuries)
        - Carbon 14 (Any form, Maximum amount requested: 15 millicuries)
        - Phosphorus 32 (Any form, Maximum amount requested: 30 millicuries)
        - Phosphorus 35 (Any form, Maximum amount requested: 30 millicuries)
        - Sulfur 35 (Any form, Maximum amount requested: 15 millicuries)
        - Iodine 125 (Any form, Maximum amount requested: 10 millicuries)
        - Cesium 137 (Sealed Source, Maximum amount requested: 5 millicuries)
        - Cobalt 60 (Sealed Source, Maximum amount requested: 5 millicuries)
        - Strontium 90 (Sealed Source, Maximum amount requested: 5 millicuries)
        - Americium 241 (Sealed Source, Maximum amount requested: 1 millicurie)
        - Nickel 63 (Sealed Foil Sources, Maximum amount requested: No single source to exceed 15 millicuries)
    Purpose: Laboratory research, teaching, and training of biology and physics students
    Individuals responsible for radiation safety program:
        - RSO: Dr. Kent W. Scheller, Ph.D.
        - AU: Several faculty members with respective expertise
    Training: Training for individuals responsible for using licensed material will take place once every two years. New users will receive training before using radioactive material.
    Facilities and Equipment: Radioactive sources will be stored in designated areas in the Science Center on campus.
    Radiation Monitoring Instruments: Victoreen Model 290 Geiger Monitor will be used for required surveys.
    Material Receipt and Accountability: All purchases of radioactive material will be initiated by an AU and approved by the RSO. Receipt of material will be documented, and physical inventories will be conducted twice a year.
    Occupational Dose: Prospective evaluation concludes that unmonitored individuals are unlikely to receive a radiation dose in excess of 10 percent of the allowable limits.
    Safe Use of Radionuclides and Emergency Procedures: Operating procedures for the safe use of isotopes and emergency procedures have been established and will be followed.
    Waste Management: Model waste procedures will be followed for proper waste disposal.
