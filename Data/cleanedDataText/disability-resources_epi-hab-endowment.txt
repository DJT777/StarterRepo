Epi-Hab Endowment to Support Students with Disabilities

    Background:
        Epi-Hab was originally a nonprofit organization in southwestern Indiana providing assistance to individuals diagnosed with epilepsy.
        It expanded to include a sheltered workplace for individuals with various disabilities.
        In 1999, the Epi-Hab Board of Directors dissolved the organization, sold its assets, and created the USI Epi-Hab Center for Disability Studies.
        The name has been changed to Epi-Hab Endowment to Support Students with Disabilities.
        The endowment is administered by the USI Office of Disability Resources.

        Support the development and offering of courses related to disability topics.
