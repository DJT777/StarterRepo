Endeavor Awards For Research & Creativity

    Program Overview: The Endeavor Awards is a competitive program for undergraduate students conducting scholarly research or creative endeavors at the University of Southern Indiana.
    Funding: Students can apply for up to $2,500 through proposals written with the guidance of their faculty sponsors.
    Presentation Requirement: Successful award recipients are required to present their research at the Endeavor Research and Creative Works Symposium.
    Grant Expenses: The grants are awarded to the student, not the faculty member. All expenses and reimbursement requests must be completed before the student's graduation.

Allowable Costs

    Equipment, lab work, materials, and travel expenses to research sites necessary for the project.
    Equipment and excess materials purchased with Endeavor funds become the property of the faculty sponsor's department.

Project Award Deadlines

    Two deadlines: Friday, October 6, 2023, and Friday, February 9, 2024.
    Submit proposals electronically to Dr. Michael Strezewski (mstrezewsk@usi.edu) in PDF format. Do not send hard copy proposals through campus mail.
