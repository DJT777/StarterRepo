University of Southern Indiana (USI) - Pre-Chiropractic Program

Overview:
The Pre-Chiropractic program at USI focuses on healthcare, specifically the skeletal system, muscular system, and nervous system. Chiropractors provide treatment through adjustments to these body systems, particularly the spinal column. They do not prescribe drugs or perform surgery.

Dual Degree Pathway:
USI has a partnership with Logan University that offers a Dual Degree Program. Students complete three years at USI, fulfilling Biology major requirements and USI's Core 39 requirements. They then transfer to Logan University for three years to begin chiropractic training and complete their bachelor's degree from USI. This program shortens the time required to obtain both degrees by one year.

Information and Resources:
For more information about the Pre-Chiropractic program at USI, including application process and requirements, you can visit the FAQ page on the university's website. Additionally, you can reach out to Dr. Henri R. Maurice, an Associate Professor of Biology, for more information regarding Pre-Chiropractic preparation in Biology.
