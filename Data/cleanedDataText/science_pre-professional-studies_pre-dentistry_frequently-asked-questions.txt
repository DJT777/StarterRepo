Pre-Dentistry Frequently Asked Questions

    What major should I select?
    - Pre-dentistry is not a major, and there is no "correct" major for pre-dentistry.
    - While most students choose majors in science areas like biology, chemistry, or math, it is not required.
    - Dental schools value candidates with diverse interests who can handle rigorous science courses.
    - The best advice is to select a major you are interested in and can do well in while also balancing the science and math courses required for dental school application.

    What classes do I need to take?
    - Each dental school has specific prerequisite course requirements.
    - It is important to identify the schools you are interested in and determine the required courses for each of them.
    - The common set of required courses typically includes biology, chemistry, physics, social science, and humanities courses.

    Do I need a 4.0 GPA?
    - While a high GPA is important for dental school admission, it is not necessary to have a perfect 4.0.
    - Dental schools typically look for a minimum overall GPA of 3.5 and a minimum GPA of 3.3 in math and science courses.
    - Participation in extracurricular activities to demonstrate interests beyond academics is also valuable.

    How do I apply?
    - Applications to dental schools are made through the American Association of Dental Schools Application System (AADSAS).
    - The application cycle begins in May and should be completed early in the summer before the senior year of undergraduate work.

    What is the DAT?
    - The Dental Admission Test (DAT) is a computer-based admission test that should be taken in the spring after the junior year of undergraduate study.
    - The DAT covers topics such as the natural sciences, perceptual ability, reading comprehension, and quantitative reasoning.

    Do I need shadowing experience?
    - Shadowing experiences are an important part of pre-dental training.
    - They provide exposure to the field of dentistry and allow students to learn firsthand about the profession.
    - Indiana University School of Dentistry requires 30-40 hours of shadowing general practice dentists.

    Tips to Remember:
    - Provide accurate information on your AADSAS application, including grades and planned courses.
    - Request transcripts from all academic institutions and allow sufficient time for processing.
    - Pay attention to the personal statement, as it is an opportunity to distinguish yourself.
    - Start the application process early to take advantage of rolling admission policies.
    - Choose letter writers carefully and provide a CV or resume for reference.
    - Familiarize yourself with the specific requirements of the dental schools you plan to apply to.
    - Get involved in extracurricular activities to demonstrate well-roundedness.
