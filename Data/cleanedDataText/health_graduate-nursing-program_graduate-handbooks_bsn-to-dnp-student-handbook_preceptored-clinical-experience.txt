    Preceptored Clinical Experience:
        Graduate nursing students completing required clinical learning hours with qualified clinical preceptors.
        Clinical practice can be completed in the student's own community.
        Preceptors cannot be relatives or in a relationship with the student.
        Approval of selected preceptors and clinical sites required from faculty prior to beginning clinical hours.
        Written agreement (Memorandum of Understanding) with the agency is necessary before initiating clinical experiences.
        Preceptors should be board-certified in specialty areas corresponding to the studentâ€™s track.
        No clinical hours during university holidays or when courses are not in session.

    Preparation Guidelines:
        Guidelines and forms to prepare for the preceptored clinical experience.
        Procedure and timeline for securing a preceptored clinical experience.
        Students responsible for identifying potential clinical preceptors in licensed locations.
        Required documentation and agreements for clinical courses.

    Typhon:
        Typhon's NP Student Tracking System (NPST) tracks and manages student clinical data securely.
        Tracks patient demographics, diagnosis and procedure codes, skills, medications, clinical notes, shift time, and activity time.
        Allows faculty and preceptors to track students' progress and accuracy in real time.
        Students must purchase the software for access during coursework and up to five years post-graduation.
