Thinking About USI?
- Students should investigate whether a course will fit into their college coursework degree map before signing up for dual credit.
- Dual-credit courses count towards the overall number of credit hours a student may receive federal financial aid for, so it's important to carefully consider registration.
- USI-bound students will be required to complete USI's Core 39 general education requirement list.
- Students are advised to consult with advisors to understand degree requirements and navigate the process.
