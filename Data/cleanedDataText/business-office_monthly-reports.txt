The Business Office at the University of Southern Indiana has implemented a series of Reports for reviewing financial information. These reports replace the previous monthly reports that were printed and distributed through campus mail. The new reports offer several features to benefit financial managers, department contacts, and authorized individuals viewing University financial information. They provide additional information such as budget transactions, three-year historical analysis, and month-to-month comparisons.
