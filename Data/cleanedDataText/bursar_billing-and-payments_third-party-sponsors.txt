    Third-Party Sponsors
        Definition: Agreement by an agency, company, foundation, or organization to pay all or a portion of a student's tuition and fees.
        Requirements:
            Notify the Bursar's Office of the sponsorship agreement and provide the terms and conditions and a billing contact.
        Billing Process:
            The Bursar's Office bills the third-party sponsor and places a temporary credit on the student's account.
            Temporary credit does not represent payment or relieve the student of financial responsibilities.
            If the sponsor does not pay, the credit is removed, and the unpaid charges become the student's responsibility.
        Different from tuition deferment or reimbursement arrangements between students and employers or organizations.
        The university offers a tuition deferment program for employer-sponsored students.
        Payment Instructions:
            Third-party sponsor checks and student payments accepted by mail or online.
            Address for mail payments:

    Third-Party Billing for Bookstore Charges:
        The Bursar's Office no longer bills bookstore charges to third parties.
        Barnes and Noble handles billing for books and bookstore supplies.
        Students using third-party billing should not charge supplies directly to their accounts.
        Any concerns regarding bookstore charges should be addressed directly with the bookstore.
