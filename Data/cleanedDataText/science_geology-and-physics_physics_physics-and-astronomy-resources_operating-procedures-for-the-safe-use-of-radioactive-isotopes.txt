APPENDIX B

- Guidelines for the safe use of radioisotope material:
    - Use under faculty supervision
    - Limit radioisotope quantity to maximum allowed dose
    - Wear personal protection equipment
    - Pregnant students cannot participate in exercises involving radioactive isotopes
    - No eating, drinking, or smoking in the laboratory
    - Body scan and survey after working with liquid sources
    - Remote pipetting for liquid sources
    - Notify radiation safety officer of contamination or spills
    - Decontamination supervised by radiation safety officer
    - Proper disposal of radioactive materials
    - Immediate survey in case of suspected personal contamination
    - Cover breaks in the skin before working with liquid radioactive materials
    - Pour active liquid wastes into labeled containers or approved sinks
    - Dispose of active solid wastes and contaminated materials in labeled containers
    - Retain active and contaminated materials within the laboratory
    - Report wounds, spills, and emergencies to an approved user
    - No ancillary personnel allowed in radiation area without supervision
