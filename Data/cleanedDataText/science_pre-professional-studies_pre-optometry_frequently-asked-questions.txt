Pre-Optometry Frequently Asked Questions

Selecting a Major:
- Pre-optometry is not a specific major, and there is no specific "correct" major for pre-optometry.
- Most students choose to major in a science area like biology, chemistry, or math, but it is not required.
- Optometry schools value candidates with diverse interests who can handle rigorous science courses.
- The advice is to select a major you are interested in and can excel in while also balancing the science and math courses required for application.

Required Courses:
- Each optometry school has specific prerequisite courses, so it is crucial to research the schools you are interested in.
- Common required courses include general biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, general physics, microbiology, psychology, English, statistics, and calculus.
- Additional recommended courses include immunology, histology, comparative chordate anatomy, and more.

Grade Point Average (GPA):
- While a high GPA is important for admission to optometry school, it is not necessary to have a perfect 4.0 GPA.
- The average GPA of successful optometry school applicants in the US is around 3.45 overall.
- Strive to maintain a competitive GPA but also demonstrate interests beyond academics through extracurricular activities.

Application Process:
- Applications to optometry schools are made through the Association of Schools and Colleges of Optometry (ASCO) via the OptomCAS system (www.optomcas.org).
- The application cycle begins in May, and it is recommended to complete the application early in the summer before your senior year of undergraduate work.

Optometry Admission Test (OAT):
- The OAT is a 5-hour computer-based admission test that should be taken in the spring after your junior year of undergraduate study.
- The test covers topics such as biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, reading comprehension, physics, and quantitative reasoning.

Shadowing Experience:
- Shadowing experiences are an essential part of pre-optometry training.
- Optometry schools may not have specific minimum required shadowing hours, but they often suggest it.
- Research the schools you are interested in to identify specific requirements.

Tips for the Application Process:
- Ensure all information entered on the OptomCAS application is accurate, including grades and planned courses.
- Request transcripts from all academic institutions and allow enough time for processing.
- Put effort into the personal statement to distinguish yourself from other applicants.
- Start the application process early, as many schools have rolling admission policies.
- Carefully select individuals to write letters of evaluation and provide them with a CV or resume.
- Understand the specific requirements of the optometry schools you plan to apply to.
