Pott College of Science, Engineering, and Education Emergency Procedures:

1. In emergency or accident situations involving radioactive materials:
    a. Restrict access to the immediate area and establish a restricted area boundary for authorized personnel only.
    b. Maintain constant surveillance of the restricted area until deemed safe for occupancy.
    c. Notify the authorized user supervising the material involved in the accident immediately.
    d. Assess minor spills and follow proper procedures for containment and cleanup.
    e. Assess major spills and follow proper procedures for evacuation, containment, and decontamination.
    f. Handle fires, explosions, or major emergencies by notifying all personnel to evacuate, contacting the fire department, and cooperating with RSO (Radiation Safety Officer) and other facility safety personnel.

2. For minor spills of liquids and solids:
    a. Notify individuals in the area of the spill.
    b. Cover the spill with absorbent paper and clean it up using gloves and absorbent paper.
    c. Dispose of contaminated materials in a radioactive waste container.
    d. Conduct surveys to check for contamination in the area and on personnel.
    e. Report the incident to the RSO promptly.

3. For major spills of liquids and solids:
    a. Clear the area and survey all uninvolved personnel, then vacate the room.
    b. Limit movement to prevent the spread of contamination.
    c. Shield the source if possible without causing further contamination or significant exposure.
    d. Secure the area and notify the RSO immediately.
    e. Decontaminate personnel by removing contaminated clothing and flushing skin with lukewarm water and mild soap.
    f. Cooperate with RSO for investigation, decontamination, and documentation.

4. For minor fires:
    a. Attempt to put out the fire using approved methods if no other hazards are present.
    b. Notify all personnel to vacate the area and call the RSO and fire department.
    c. Survey individuals involved in firefighting for possible contamination.
    d. Decontaminate personnel and follow instructions from the RSO for decontamination and area cleanup.

5. For fires, explosions, or major emergencies:
    a. Notify all personnel to leave the area immediately.
    b. Notify the fire department and the RSO.
    c. Collaborate with the RSO and facility safety personnel to provide information on location of radioactive materials and precautions to avoid exposure or contamination risks.
    d. Cooperate with the RSO for investigation and follow their instructions for decontamination and documentation.

Note: Proper training and supervision are required for handling radioactive materials and conducting decontamination and recovery operations.
