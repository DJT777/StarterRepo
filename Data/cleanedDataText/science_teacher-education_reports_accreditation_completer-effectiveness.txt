Teacher Effectiveness and Teacher Impact on P-12 Student Learning (CAEP Accountability Measure 1)

The University of Southern Indiana complies with Indiana legislation (IC20-28-11.5-9) requiring school corporations/districts to provide annual disaggregated results of staff performance evaluations to the Indiana Department of Education (IDOE). The legislation mandates that locally developed evaluation instruments include objective measures of student achievement and growth in both tested and non-tested areas, as well as rigorous measures of effectiveness.

Evaluation results for first, second, and third year teachers are linked to the teacher preparation institution that provided their training. The positive evaluation results of program completers show that completers positively impact P-12 student learning and effectively apply the professional knowledge, skills, and dispositions gained from their preparation experiences.
