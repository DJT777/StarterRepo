Once you've applied and been accepted to your study abroad program, you need to attend the Mandatory Study Abroad Orientation. During the orientation, important information about next steps, international travel, health and safety abroad, visas, cultural adjustment, required paperwork, and other related topics will be discussed. You will also have the opportunity to ask questions and receive advice from USI students who have recently studied abroad.

Additionally, you must review and submit the appropriate completed forms for your study abroad program following the orientation.
