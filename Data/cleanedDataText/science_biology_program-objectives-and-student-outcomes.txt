Biology Program Objectives and Student Outcomes

Program Objectives:

1. Graduates have sufficient background in Biology content and basic scientific skills to succeed in post-baccalaureate programs (graduate school, professional school, fellowships) and careers in teaching and industry.
2. Graduates effectively analyze biological information from a wide array of sources and apply their scientific knowledge to problems and situations they face in their professional lives and in their communities.
3. Graduates have effective communication skills enabling them to convey biological information and results (data, observations, interpretations) of investigations of biological significance to professional colleagues and members of their community.
4. Graduates have an appreciation for and actively seek out opportunities for life-long learning.

Student Outcomes:
