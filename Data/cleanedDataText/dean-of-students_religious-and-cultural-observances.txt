Religious and Cultural Observances

USI's Commitment:
   - USI is committed to enhancing cultural awareness in a diverse and global community.
   - Recognizes the importance of religious and cultural expression for students, faculty, and staff.

Accommodations:
   - USI follows an academic calendar where classes are not in session on certain national holidays and religious observances.
   - However, there are numerous other holidays and religious practices that are not officially recognized.
   - Students are encouraged to approach faculty early in the semester to request accommodations for their religious and cultural observances.
   - Accommodations may include excused absences, additional time for assignments or exams, or rescheduling of quizzes or exams.
   - Faculty are encouraged, but not required, to accommodate such requests.
   - Students should understand that accommodation does not excuse them from responsibilities and deadlines.
   - It is important to open a dialogue with faculty to ensure clear communication of requests and arrangements.
