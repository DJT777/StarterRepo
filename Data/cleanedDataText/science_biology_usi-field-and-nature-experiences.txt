Pott College of Science, Engineering, and Education - Biology Program - Field and Nature Experiences

USI Students in the Biology program at the University of Southern Indiana have unique opportunities to study biology in its natural environment. The program offers various field resources for students to explore and learn. Some of the field resources available at USI are:

1. USI Nature Preserve:
   - Comprises 730 acres of mostly mesic forest land adjacent to campus.
   - Used for research projects in biology, geology, and engineering.
   - Provides opportunities for students to work in the preserve as part of coursework and research.
   - Numerous peer-reviewed publications and presentations have resulted from research conducted in the preserve.

2. Belize Marine TREC:
   - USI has had a partnership with the Belize Tropical Research and Education Center for over 20 years.
   - Allows students to study marine species and ecology in Indiana and then travel to Belize to observe those species up close.
   - Students participate in snorkeling trips to explore the meso-American barrier reef, encounter charismatic marine life, and learn about intertidal and mangrove communities.
   - Ongoing research projects provide opportunities for students to be involved in marine biology and novel research.

3. USI Bird Boxes:
   - Bird boxes have been maintained and monitored on campus since 1973.
   - Provides insights into nesting behavior and how it changes with weather and climate changes in Southern Indiana.
   - Students gain field and data analysis experience by checking the boxes regularly for nesting activity and chicks or eggs.

4. Twin Swamps:
   - Twin Swamps Nature Preserve, located west of the USI campus, offers an opportunity to explore native plant and animal species in a swamp ecosystem.
   - Consists of a Cottonwood-Bald Cypress Swamp, Overcup Oak Swamp, and southern flatwoods.
   - Home to a variety of plants, including Virginia bluebells and bald cypress trees.
   - Provides a chance to study a unique environment and contributes to research publications.

For more information, students can visit the Biology program's social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram.

Contact information for the Biology program can be found in the Science Center 1273, and inquiries can be made via email.
