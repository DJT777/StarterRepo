Financial & Academic Information - Study Abroad

Financial Aid:

- Contact the Office of Student Financial Assistance to ensure that any financial assistance received will be applied towards program fees.
- File the FAFSA form between October 1st and April 15th for maximum financial aid consideration.
- Study abroad grades may take several weeks to process, so the Office of Student Financial Assistance will evaluate eligibility for financial aid probation based on the Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) policy.
- Enrollment verification form: Students must be registered for the equivalent of 12 U.S. credit hours each semester, and this form serves as proof of full-time enrollment for financial aid purposes. It should be completed upon arrival at the host institution and signed by the host coordinator.

Federal Direct Loans for Study Abroad Students:

- Students requesting an academic year loan will continue to receive disbursements to their USI account after starting course work at the host institution.
- Students requesting a Direct Loan for only one semester must receive their loan disbursements in two installments, made to the USI account when course work begins and mid-way through the semester.

Early Registration for the Semester Following Study Abroad:

- Students will be able to register online through myUSI on their designated date and time.
- Any holds on the account should be cleared before departure.

Courses and Academic Credit:

- Study abroad participants will receive USI credit and grades for all coursework completed during the program.
- Students are registered for full-time "Study Abroad" credit at USI and also enrolled in courses at the host institution.
- The actual number of credit hours earned can exceed 15 credit hours, and students may be charged additional USI tuition for credit hours exceeding 15.
- Approval for study abroad course credit should be obtained prior to departure by completing the Course Approval Record. This form needs to be submitted to the Center for International Programs (CIP).
- Pass/No Pass option is available but must be notified to the CIP office within the first week of the semester overseas.

Transcripts and Course Transfer:

- CIP will receive an official transcript from the study abroad program or sponsoring institution after the completion of the program.
- Grades and credit hours will be translated into USI equivalents and posted on the student's USI transcript.
- Failure to provide the final official academic transcript from the study abroad institution within the following semester will result in 'F' grades on the USI transcript.
- A hold will be placed on the account until the final official study abroad transcript is received.
