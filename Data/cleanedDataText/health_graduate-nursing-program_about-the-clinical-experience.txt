About the Clinical Experience

    Students are required to find a preceptor for clinical courses in the MSN program.
    If students have difficulty finding a site, they can contact faculty or the graduate chair for assistance.
    Assistance is provided in setting up contracts and communication between the preceptor and nursing faculty.
    For more information, students can refer to the Student Handbook.
