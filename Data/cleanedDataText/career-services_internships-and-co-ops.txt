        Co-Ops: Full-time work for a semester, followed by a semester of classes. Format varies by industry and employer.

    Minimum Criteria:
        General Internship: Completed at least one semester at USI and in good standing.
        Major-Specific Internship: Criteria specific to each major, such as minimum GPA and prerequisite classes.

    Appointment and Resume:
        Schedule an appointment with a USI Career Coordinator to discuss internship options and receive resume assistance.
        Bring a copy of your updated resume to the appointment. Career Services is located in the Orr Center, Room 074.
        Having a resume is typically required by employers when applying for internships.

Recording Your Internship:

    Use Career Launch, the official database for internships and work-based experiences, to report your internship.
    Submit a new Experiential Learning form for each semester, even if working with the same employer.
    Career Launch serves as the official record of your internship and can be used for verification purposes.
    Reporting your internship helps track important details and aids in future job applications.

Evaluations:

    Mid-term and final evaluations are conducted for internships.
    Students and employers receive evaluations to assess performance and learning.
    Evaluation timelines vary based on the semester of the internship.

Major-Specific Internship Programs:

    Some majors require internships to complete the degree.
    Requirements vary by major.

Using Your Job as an Internship:

    In some cases, your part-time or full-time job can count as an internship.
    Schedule an appointment with a USI Career Coordinator for guidelines and details.

NACE Guidelines: Career Services operates according to the guidelines set by the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE).
