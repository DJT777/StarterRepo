USI CAP Courses

The College Achievement Program (CAP) at the University of Southern Indiana (USI) offers over 30 courses in participating high schools. Effective Summer 2023, CAP courses are offered at no charge to students and families. These courses not only apply to USI but also have a high rate of transferability to other institutions. More than half of the USI CAP courses are part of the Indiana Core Transfer Library (CTL), which helps determine how college credits transfer among Indiana public institutions and some independent colleges and universities.

Using the Indiana Core Transfer Library:

1. Visit www.transferin.net/transfer-resources/transfer-databases/core-transfer-library
2. Use the drop-down menu under Institution to filter by college or university, AND/OR
3. Use the CTL Name to filter by course name (see list below)
4. To remove the filter, click on 'Clear Filters' or de-select the college or course in the drop-down menu.

The CTL Name represents various course names across the state. All courses shown under a CTL course name are equivalent courses. For example, USI's ENG 101, Rhetoric and Composition I: Literacy & the Self, can be found under the CTL course title of English Composition 1. As long as the course is completed with a grade of C or higher, all institutions showing an equivalent course should accept the USI course. If your prospective college or university is not listed or if you have questions about the Notes category, contact the Registrar's Office there to inquire about accepting USI credit before submitting your CAP application.

Please refer to the USI Academic Bulletin for complete course descriptions by clicking on the USI course titles in the chart.
