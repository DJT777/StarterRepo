Academic Information for International Students at the University of Southern Indiana (USI)

Academic Differences in the American Higher Education System:

- Classroom participation is encouraged in most classes and required in others.
- Students are encouraged to contact professors outside of class for help and support.
- Attendance is often mandatory, and excessive absences can negatively impact grades.
- In addition to tests and papers, many professors assign regular assignments or quizzes for grading.

University Core 39:

- USI's University Core 39 program helps students acquire discipline-specific competence and broader knowledge and skills across disciplines.
- It consists of foundation skills (14 hours), bachelor of arts or science requirements (13 hours), ways of knowing (12 hours), and embedded experiences (4 courses).

USI Grading System:

- Letter grades are used to indicate the quality of completed coursework.
- Grade points are assigned to letter grades, and a grade point average (GPA) is calculated based on earned grade points divided by quality hours attempted.
- Grades range from A (excellent) to F (failure), with additional designations for satisfactory/passing or unsatisfactory/not passing grades.

Good Standing, Academic Progress, and Probation:

- Students must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA to be in good academic standing.
- Undergraduate students with a GPA below 2.0 will have a registration hold placed on their record.
- Students failing to meet minimum GPA standards may be placed on academic probation.
- During the probationary semester, students should utilize available resources and improve academic performance.

Academic Honesty and Assistance:

- Academic dishonesty, including plagiarism and cheating, is not tolerated and may result in disciplinary action.
- USI offers resources for academic assistance, including peer tutoring in various subjects and writing assistance through the Writing Center and Online Writing Lab.
- The university's academic calendar provides important dates, and international students must be registered for a full-time course load by the end of the first week of classes to maintain visa status.
