    Transferability of CAP Courses:
        Non-USI bound students can check how their USI coursework transfers through the Indiana Core Transfer Library or Transferology.
        Dual-credit courses count towards the overall number of credit hours eligible for federal financial aid, so careful consideration is needed.
        Students should request their official transcript to be sent to their institution (if not attending USI) in myUSI.
        Transcripts can be requested once CAP grades are officially recorded.
        Students should bring an unofficial transcript from myUSI to orientation for advising and class registration.
        Students are advised to investigate how CAP courses will transfer to prospective institutions and fit into their degree plans.
        Video tutorial available on investigating transferability for non-USI bound students.
