Be Well to Do Well

Be Rested

Sufficient sleep is crucial for both physical and emotional well-being. Lack of sleep not only affects a person's ability to focus and learn efficiently but also increases the risk of illness and injury due to sleepiness. Getting adequate sleep allows our bodies to repair, consolidate memories, and be alert for important tasks. To help you be rested, here are some tips:

1. Create a relaxing sleep environment: In apartments and residence halls, noise can be a disturbance. Use earplugs, white noise machines, fans, or relaxing instrumental music to create a quieter environment. Block excess light with curtains or an eye mask.

2. Use your bed for sleep only: Train your body to associate your bed with sleeping by avoiding studying or doing homework on it.

3. Avoid substances that disrupt sleep: Caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol can negatively impact sleep quality. Avoid consuming them within 3-4 hours of bedtime.

4. Work on reducing stress: If worries keep you up at night, practice stress reduction techniques such as attending yoga classes, practicing mindfulness, or deep breathing.

5. Practice time management: Avoid all-nighters by planning ahead and completing assignments early. Break large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks and work on them well in advance.

6. Maintain a regular sleep schedule: Try to go to bed and wake up around the same time each day to establish a consistent sleep routine.

7. Create a nightly relaxation ritual: Engage in activities that help your body wind down before bed, such as listening to calming music, taking a warm shower, or practicing relaxation techniques.

8. Unplug before bed: The blue light emitted by cell phones, computers, and TVs can disrupt sleep. Limit technology use 1-2 hours before bed.

If you feel tired or sluggish during the day, taking a short nap can provide a quick boost in energy and alertness. Keep your nap to 20-30 minutes to avoid disrupting your regular sleep cycle and experiencing grogginess.
