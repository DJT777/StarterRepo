General Guidelines for the Purchase of Food from University Funds:

Allowable activities without tax consequences include:
    - Official business of the Board of Trustees
    - Official University-wide functions
    - University-wide training or recognition
    - Events for student recruitment, recognition, or attendance
    - Extended Services courses with a hospitality cost factor
    - Meals required during working hours without an alternate time opportunity
    - Meetings or events with community members or non-employees for official University business or representation
    - Meetings with representatives from multiple departments where the cost per person is less than $50
    - Employee training, recognition, and celebrations conducted away from the employee's regular work location if the cost per person is less than $50
    - Meals provided to the spouse of an employee representing the University and attendance is required or expected.

Purchase of Gifts, Prizes, Awards, and Giveaways:

Payments to individuals for services, appreciation, recognition, prizes, and awards are considered taxable income and subject to tax withholding.
Payments must be made directly to the individual from the University through Accounts Payable or Payroll to comply with IRS requirements.
Third-party payments to individuals for services, prizes, awards, gifts, or giveaways are not permitted and will not be reimbursed by the University.
Form W9 (Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification) or University ID number must be submitted to the Accounts Payable department for any gift, prize, award, or giveaway provided by the University.
Gift certificates, gift cards, and financial instruments redeemable for cash are considered cash equivalents and taxable income to the recipient regardless of the dollar value.

Apparel for Employees:

Value of work clothing provided by the employer is not taxable to the employee if the clothing is:
    - Worn as a condition of employment
    - Not suitable for everyday wear
Purchase of employee apparel must be identified regardless of dollar value.

Tax Reporting Requirements:

Payments made to non-employees (gift cards, gift certificates, cash equivalents) regardless of dollar value require submission of Form W9.
Payments made to employees and students (gift cards, gift certificates, cash equivalents) regardless of dollar value require names and University ID numbers.
Non-cash gifts, awards, prizes, and giveaways to non-employees and employees must be reported when the total expense is $50 or more.
Apparel purchases for employees and non-employees must be reported when the total expense is $50 or more.
Recipients' names and University ID numbers must be attached to payment documentation for reporting purposes.
