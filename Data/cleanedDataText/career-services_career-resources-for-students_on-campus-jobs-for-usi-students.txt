On-Campus Jobs for USI Students

Career Services and Internships at University of Southern Indiana (USI) provides resources and support for students seeking on-campus job opportunities. Here are some details and information:

Access Career Launch: Many student worker positions are posted on Career Launch, which can be accessed through the myUSI dashboard.

Sodexo Jobs: Sodexo is the food service company on campus and hires many student workers for on-campus food service positions. These positions often pay more than minimum wage and offer additional perks, such as food credits to eat on campus. Interested students can apply through the Sodexo website.

Other Offices: Various other offices on campus accept applications on a walk-in basis. It is recommended to bring a copy of your resume when applying. The David L. Rice Library accepts applications ongoing, and students can apply online and submit their current class schedule. Bulletin boards outside department offices may also have postings for job openings.

Recreation, Fitness, and Wellness Center: The Recreation, Fitness, and Wellness Center occasionally posts jobs on Career Launch or their website. Watch for details during the hiring periods.

Summer Rehab Program: During the summer, housing hires many students for the Summer Rehab program, which involves cleaning and refurbishing housing units. Details about these positions can be found on Career Launch and the USI Employment Page.

University Employment Page: Full-time and part-time positions at the university that are not student worker positions are listed on the University employment page.
