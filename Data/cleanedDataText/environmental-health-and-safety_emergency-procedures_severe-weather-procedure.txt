Severe Weather Procedure

The University Safety Committee at the University of Southern Indiana wants the entire community to be prepared for the upcoming severe weather and tornado season. Here are some actions that you need to be prepared to take:

Tornado Warning:

- When a tornado warning has been issued for your area, seek safe shelter immediately.
- If you are in a small or lightly built structure, move to a safe area in a larger, heavily constructed building.
- If there is no time to escape to a larger building, seek the safest area in your building.
- In a larger building, move to an interior hallway or room on the lowest floor away from windows, doors, and outside walls.
- Do not attempt to outrun a tornado in a vehicle. Leave the vehicle immediately and find safe shelter.
- If caught outside with no shelter, lie flat in a nearby ditch or depression and cover your head with your hands. Do not seek shelter under an overpass or bridge.
- Protect yourself from flying debris, which causes most fatalities and injuries during tornadoes.

Tornado Watch vs. Tornado Warning:

- When conditions are favorable for severe weather development, a severe thunderstorm or tornado watch is issued. Remain alert for approaching storms.
- When a watch is issued, tune in to NOAA Weather Radio, commercial radio, or television for the latest watch or warning information.
- When a tornado warning is issued, a tornado has been sighted or indicated by weather radar. Move immediately to your pre-designated place of safety.

Outdoor Areas:

- If you are at an outdoor recreation field or caught outside when a severe weather siren sounds, seek safe shelter immediately.
- Go to the nearest safe area. If none is available, lie flat in a nearby ditch or depression away from trees or power lines, and cover your head with your hands to protect yourself from flying debris.

USI Apartment Buildings:

- If you are located in a USI apartment building and hear an emergency warning siren, move to an interior room such as a bathroom or hallway away from exterior walls and windows.
- If possible, lay flat in the bathtub and cover your head to protect yourself from flying debris. Bring a battery-powered weather radio, blanket, and flashlight with you.

Safe Areas:

- A safe area is defined as an interior hallway or room on the lowest floor of a larger, heavily constructed building away from windows, doors, and outside walls.
- Refer to the provided attachment for a list of buildings with safe areas for severe weather and tornadoes.
