Pott College of Science, Engineering, and Education - Chemistry and Biochemistry Advising Information

Students in the Chemistry and Biochemistry programs at the University of Southern Indiana receive advising support from full-time chemistry faculty throughout their academic journey. These faculty members are available during the academic year to discuss goals, career options, and academic progress. Close collaboration between students and advisors greatly contributes to their success.

For first-year students, transfer students preparing to be admitted to their major, or Pott College students seeking academic and career advising, the Student Advising and Resource Center is available for assistance.

Sample Four-Year Plans:
- Suggested four-year plans based on Math preparedness are provided as examples. Students' actual four-year plan will be designed with an academic advisor, considering any transfer credits and career goals.
