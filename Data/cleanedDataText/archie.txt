History of Archibald T. Eagle:

    The screaming eagle mascot tradition started in 1970 at the University of Southern Indiana.
    In 1978, a contest was held to name the mascot, and the winning name was Archibald T. Eagle (Archie).
    In 2014, as part of the USI brand evolution, a makeover was given to Archie based on input from the USI community.
    The new look maintained the original coloration of brown feathers and gold beak and legs but incorporated the school colors of blue, red, and white in his apparel.
