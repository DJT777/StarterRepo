Be Calm

Stress is an unavoidable part of life, but how we manage and respond to it can greatly impact our well-being. Developing skills for stress management and positive self-care can help us navigate life's challenges more effectively. Here are some tips for finding calm:

Tips for Managing Stress:

1. Practice positive self-care: Take intentional actions to enhance your well-being, such as engaging in healthy behaviors, getting adequate sleep, and maintaining good nutrition. Avoid using alcohol and drugs to cope with stress.

2. Exercise: Regular physical activity has been shown to reduce symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. Start moving and check out the Recreation, Fitness, and Wellness Center for more options.

3. Reach out to others: It can be tempting to isolate ourselves when facing stress, but talking to a trusted friend, family member, or counselor can help process our experiences.

4. Reframe your thoughts: Take a step back and challenge negative thoughts about a stressful situation. Consider alternative perspectives and viewpoints.

5. Practice deep breathing: When stressed, our body undergoes changes like increased heart rate and blood pressure. Deep breathing exercises can counteract these effects. Place one hand on your chest and the other on your abdomen. Take slow, deep breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth, feeling your abdomen rise and fall.

6. Engage in relaxation exercises: In addition to deep breathing, activities like progressive muscle relaxation, visualization, drawing, coloring, and listening to music can promote relaxation.

7. Spend time with animals: Interacting with animals can be therapeutic and help reduce stress. Consider visiting animals in the community, volunteering at the humane society, or attending programs like Paws & Play where therapy dogs come to campus.

8. Write in a journal: Journaling can be a helpful way to process thoughts and emotions related to stress.

9. Practice gratitude: Reflecting on things we are grateful for can decrease stress and foster a more positive outlook. Write down three good things or specific aspects of gratitude each day.

10. Use adaptive time management skills: Feeling overwhelmed by demands is common for students. Learning prioritization and time management skills can help alleviate stress. Resources On-Campus Resources:
