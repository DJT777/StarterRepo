Pre-Veterinary Frequently Asked Questions

Pott College of Science, Engineering, and Education

What major should I select? 
- There is no specific major required for pre-veterinary. Most students choose a science area like biology, but it is not mandatory. Veterinary schools look for candidates with diverse interests who can handle rigorous science courses. Choose a major you are interested in and can balance with the required science and math courses.

What classes do I need to take? 
- Undergraduate requirements vary between schools. It is your responsibility to know the specific requirements for the schools you wish to attend. Commonly required courses include general biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, general physics, microbiology, biochemistry, genetics, statistics, English composition, communication, and humanities.

Do I need a 4.0 GPA? 
- While a high GPA is important, a 4.0 is not necessary. The average GPA of successful veterinary applicants in the US is around 3.5. Strive to maintain a competitive GPA but also focus on extracurricular activities to showcase interests beyond academics. Some vet schools may specifically consider your GPA in science courses or your GPA in your last 45 hours of courses.

How do I apply? 
- Applications to veterinary schools are made through the American Association of Veterinary Medical Colleges (AAVMC) via the VMCAS system. The application cycle starts in May and should be completed early in the summer before your senior year. Check the AAVMC Applicant Guide for application requirements.

Do I need to take the GRE? 
- Some vet programs require the Graduate Record Exam (GRE), while others do not. Contact the admissions office of your target schools for specific requirements.

Do I need shadowing experience? 
- Accumulating animal experience is valuable. Volunteer at animal shelters, zoos, therapeutic riding centers, rescues, and other places to gain interaction with animals. Most schools do not have minimum shadowing requirements, but check the specific requirements of the programs you're applying to. Many schools require a letter of recommendation from a veterinarian, so shadowing can provide an opportunity for that.

Tips to remember: 
- Ensure that all application information is accurate.
- Request transcripts from all academic institutions well in advance.
- Pay attention to the personal statement.
- Apply early in the application window.
- Choose recommenders carefully and provide them with enough time to write letters.
- Clearly communicate your application deadlines to your letter writers.
- Understand the specific requirements of the veterinary schools you are applying to.
- Balance academics with other activities to be a well-rounded candidate.
