Health Insurance, Immunizations, & Medications for Study Abroad

Health Insurance:

- All participants of USI study abroad programs are required to have adequate health insurance.
- Some programs may require specific health insurance registration and include the cost in the program fee.
- Check your current health insurance for information on coverage while abroad and consider supplemental coverage if necessary.
- Several travel insurance companies offer short-term policies, such as the ISIC card.
- Familiarize yourself with the procedures for securing health care and making a claim with your insurance company before traveling.
- Make note of instructions, your insurance agent's contact information, and leave a copy at home with someone you can contact in case of emergency.

Immunizations:

- Check immunization requirements and recommendations for your host country.
- Investigate any regional health or medical advisories that may have been issued.
- If you have special health needs, inquire about any specific conditions that may apply to your travel overseas.
- Passport Health, the largest provider of travel medical services in the United States, offers destination-specific travel information, immunizations, travel shots, specialty travel products, and international travel health insurance.
- The Vanderburgh County Health Department provides free foreign travel immunization information and consultations.
- Gather necessary information before visiting, including your full name, address, phone number, date of birth, countries to visit, departure date, length and type of trip, medications or health problems, allergies, and vaccination/testing records.
- The Center for Disease Control (CDC) website provides comprehensive information on required and recommended vaccinations, food and water precautions, and geographic health recommendations.
- Some vaccination series may require starting up to six months in advance, so plan ahead and research immunizations early.
- Consider vaccination for Hepatitis A if traveling to Mexico or other locations, as it can be caused by food or water contamination.
- For travel to South America, Africa, Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, Russia, or remote areas, consult the CDC website and visit your physician or a travel doctor at the Public Health Department.
