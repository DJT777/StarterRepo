    Purpose:
        Faculty learning communities (FLCs) aim to enhance a sense of community among faculty members. They offer opportunities for interdisciplinary connections, collaborations, and discussions about teaching and learning. FLCs provide a space for faculty to explore, experiment, and adopt new teaching methods.

    Structure:
        FLCs consist of approximately 8-12 USI faculty members.
        Meetings: FLCs meet approximately every three weeks during the semester.
        Topics: Each FLC focuses on a specific topic related to teaching and learning, such as student engagement, effective teaching practices, technology integration, creativity, experiential learning, or distance learning.
        Activities: FLCs have flexibility in determining their own schedule and activities. These may include discussions, sharing ideas and projects, peer feedback, and attending activities together.
        Product or Project: FLC members are encouraged to work on a specific product or project related to the chosen topic. Examples include incorporating experiential learning activities, designing new courses, developing assessment tools, or implementing technology applications.

    Expectations:
        Active Participation: Members are expected to actively participate in FLC meetings and activities, with at least 75% attendance.
        Contribution: Members are encouraged to contribute to discussions and share their expertise.

    Types of FLCs:
        Theoretical and Discussion-based: FLCs focused on theoretical exploration and discussion.
        Project-based: FLCs centered around collaborative projects.

    Sample Topics:
        Interdisciplinary Teaching and Research
        Service Learning
        Collaborative Learning Environments
        Flipped Learning
        Blended and Hybrid Learning
        Technology-Enhanced Learning

    Additional Topics:
        Topics for Communities of Practice (Department and Program Chairs) are determined based on faculty interests.
