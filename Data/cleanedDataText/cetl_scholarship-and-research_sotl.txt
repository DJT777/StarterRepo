SoTL Fellows Program

    Description: The SoTL Fellows Program provides USI faculty members with the opportunity to develop and carry out a scholarly project that investigates connections between teaching and student learning and/or student success. Fellows will participate in a learning community, receive support and guidance, and establish collegial connections across disciplines. The program runs from March 2022 to May 2023, and selected participants will receive a $1,000 stipend upon completion.
    Eligibility: Full-time faculty members at the University of Southern Indiana (excluding current SoTL Fellows).
    Application: Apply online by the specified deadline (March 15, 2022).
    Selection process: Applications will be evaluated based on the proposed project's connection to student learning or success, impact on teaching, potential contribution to enhanced understanding of teaching and student learning at USI, commitment to program participation, and feasibility. Up to five participants will be selected.
    Congratulations to the 2021 and 2022 SoTL Fellows.

SoTL Resources: A directory of teaching journals and conferences, advice for new SoTL researchers, planning resources, and more.
