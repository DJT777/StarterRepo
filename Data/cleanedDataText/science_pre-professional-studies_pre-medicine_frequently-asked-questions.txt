Pott College of Science, Engineering, and Education - Pre-Medicine FAQs

What major should I select?

- Pre-medicine is not a major, and there is no specific major required for pre-medicine. Students can choose majors in science areas like biology, chemistry, or math, but majors in liberal arts and business can also be successful.

What classes do I need to take?

- The required courses for medical school acceptance include two semesters of biology with laboratory, two semesters of general chemistry with laboratory, two semesters of organic chemistry with laboratory, two semesters of physics with laboratory, one semester of biochemistry, one course in social sciences, and one course in psychology. Additional courses in animal physiology, genetics, anatomy, physiology, microbiology, immunology, and histology are recommended but not required.

Do I need a 4.0 GPA?

- While a high GPA is important, it is not necessary to have a perfect 4.0. It is more important to have a solid GPA in the range of 3.80-4.00 and demonstrate involvement in extracurricular activities.

How do I apply?

- The formal application process for medical school usually begins during the summer before graduation. Most medical schools participate in the centralized application service called the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS). Students complete the application forms online, and AMCAS forwards the completed applications to the designated schools.

What is the MCAT?

- The Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) is required by almost every medical school. It is a computer-based exam that assesses knowledge and skills necessary for success in medical school. It is recommended to take the exam in April or May of your junior year.

Do I need shadowing experience?

- Not all medical schools require shadowing, but it is highly recommended. Shadowing experiences provide valuable insights into the medical profession. It is advisable to have at least three significant shadowing experiences in different specialties.

Additional Tips:

- Ensure accuracy in the information entered on the AMCAS application.
- Request transcripts from all academic institutions and allow sufficient processing time.
- Pay attention to the personal statement on the AMCAS application.
- Designate AMCAS as a recipient of MCAT scores.
- Start the application process early to have more opportunities for admission.
- Give ample time for individuals writing letters of evaluation.
- Be well-rounded and balance academics with other activities.
