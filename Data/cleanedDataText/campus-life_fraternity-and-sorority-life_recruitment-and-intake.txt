Joining a fraternity or sorority at the University of Southern Indiana (USI) is a lifelong commitment to fraternal values of leadership. Fraternities and sororities select their members through a recruitment process. USI's Interfraternity Council (IFC) and Panhellenic organizations have both formal and informal recruitment processes. Formal recruitment occurs in the fall semester with all chapters, while informal recruitment takes place in the spring semester (some chapters may choose not to participate). National Pan-Hellenic Council/National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations (NPHC/NALFO) fraternities and sororities select their members through a process known as intake, which can occur at any time throughout the year.
