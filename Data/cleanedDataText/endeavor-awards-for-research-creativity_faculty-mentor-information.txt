Endeavor Awards for Research & Creativity

    Categories:
        - Student Collaboration Awards
        - Student Presentation Awards
        - Endeavor Symposium

Faculty Mentor Information:

    Endeavor proposals must be written by the student(s), with guidance from the faculty sponsor.
    The faculty sponsor will help the student produce a well-written proposal, including an accurate budget and project timeline.
    Projects without a substantial student research or creative component will not be considered.
    The Endeavor Committee recommends that students submit proposals to their faculty mentor at least ten days before the Endeavor proposal deadline.
    The faculty mentor will review the proposal, provide feedback, and recommend the project for funding.
    The faculty mentor is expected to attend the annual Endeavor Symposium.
    Endeavor grants are awarded directly to the student, not the faculty member.
    All grant expenses and reimbursement requests must be completed before the student's graduation.
