College of Science, Engineering, and Education - Mechanical Engineering

Program Educational Objectives:

1. Program graduates will contribute to the mechanical engineering profession. This objective is achieved if most graduates are working in mechanical engineering or related fields within five years.

2. Program graduates will contribute to the regional economy in a mechanical engineering related field. This objective is achieved if most graduates are employed in a mechanical engineering related field within the tri-state region surrounding Evansville, Indiana after five years.

Student Outcomes:

These outcomes align with the ABET General Criterion 3 "1 through 7":

1. Identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems using principles of engineering, science, and mathematics.
2. Apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs, considering public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors.
3. Communicate effectively with a range of audiences.
4. Recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments considering the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts.
5. Function effectively on a team, providing leadership, creating a collaborative and inclusive environment, establishing goals, planning tasks, and meeting objectives.
6. Develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions.
