Disability Resources

    What is Disability Resources?
        Disability Resources coordinates services and accommodations for students with disabilities to ensure equal access to classes, activities, facilities, programs, and services.

    Who can work with Disability Resources?
        Any student with a documented disability, including those with learning, psychiatric, physical, neurological, or temporary disabilities, can work with the Disability Resources Office.

    What kind of documentation is needed for accommodations?
        The required documentation depends on the type of disability. Specific documentation requirements can be found on the documentation page of the Disability Resources website.

    What kind of accommodations are available in college?
        Accommodations are tailored to individual student needs. Examples include extra time on exams, reduced distraction areas, readers/scribes, note takers, alternative format textbooks, sign language interpreters, recorders, and enlarged materials.

    Will I receive the same accommodations as in my IEP or 504 plan?
        Not necessarily. While the IEP or 504 plan can provide useful information, documentation such as a recent psychological evaluation or letter from a doctor is required for discussing accommodations at the college level.

    How long does it take to get accommodations after submitting documentation?
        Once documentation is received and reviewed, Disability Resources staff will contact the student to schedule an appointment. It is recommended to submit information at least 30 days before services are needed, and 60 days prior for accommodations involving external services or materials.

    Will my instructors know about my disability?
        Disclosure of disability information to instructors is at the student's discretion. Disability Resources provides a letter listing accommodations, which can be given to instructors. It is recommended to have a conversation with instructors about your needs.
