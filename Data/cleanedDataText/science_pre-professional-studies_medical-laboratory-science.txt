Pott College of Science, Engineering, and Education - Medical Laboratory Science

Medical Laboratory Science is a critical field in healthcare that involves providing laboratory analyses and assisting physicians in treatment and diagnosis. These professionals work on the front lines of the Covid-19 pandemic by managing Covid testing in hospitals and laboratories. Accurate laboratory test results, data integration, and the ability to evaluate results are essential for keeping people healthy.

Dual Degree Pathway with IU Medical Lab Science:

- Earn two Bachelor's degrees in as little as 4 years without leaving Evansville, IN.
- USI offers a 3+1 program with Indiana University School of Medicine - Evansville.
- Earn a B.S. in Biology from USI and a B.S. in Medical Laboratory Science from IU in just 4 years.
- Alternatively, pursue a Bachelor's degree in Medical Laboratory Science as a second degree following your degree at USI. This option is suitable for career changers and students seeking post-baccalaureate training.

Coursework:

- Pre-requisite coursework is required for students interested in MLS training, which is a part of their USI Biology or Biochemistry degree.
- Typical pre-requisite coursework includes:
    - 16 hours of Biology (Principles of Biology, Zoology, Microbiology, Immunology, Genetics, and Anatomy & Physiology)
    - 16 hours of Chemistry (General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Quantitative Analysis)
    - 3 hours of Math (Biostatistics or Principles of Statistics)
    - Other suggested courses: Physics, Histology, Comparative Anatomy, Physiology

Success Stories:

- Marie Bland '15: Lab Supervisor at Zoetis Reference Laboratories. She initially planned to take the MCAT but decided to become a medical laboratory scientist. USI professors helped her find the required courses, navigate different programs, and provided recommendations.
