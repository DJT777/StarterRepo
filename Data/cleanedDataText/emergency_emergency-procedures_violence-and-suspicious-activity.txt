Violence and Suspicious Activity

        Try to prevent escalation and appease the person.
        Consult someone in authority.
        Move to a public area if isolated with the threatening person.
        If accompanied by the person, bring them to a common area and discreetly contact Public Safety.

    Non-Immediate Threatening Behavior:
        If there is no immediate threat but behavior is concerning, gather information about the person and contact Public Safety.

        Place the item in a plastic bag, seal it, and place it in a second plastic bag.
        Stay in your office or immediate work area.
