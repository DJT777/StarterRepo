College Achievement Program (CAP)

    Overview
        Program Name: College Achievement Program (CAP)
        Purpose: Provides eligible high school students the opportunity to earn college credits while still in high school.

    How to Apply:
        Application Process: Information on how to apply is available on the website.
        Paying the Bill: Information on how to pay the CAP course fees is available on the website.
        Dropping a CAP Course:
            Reasons for Dropping a Course: Various reasons, such as transferability of credits, not needed for intended major, poor performance, or withdrawal from school.
            Importance of Notifying the CAP Office: Simply informing the teacher or counselor is not sufficient. The CAP Office needs to submit a form to the USI Registrar's Office to officially remove a student from a CAP course.
            Who Can Notify the CAP Office: It is preferred that the student notifies the CAP Office directly. However, the instructor or counselor can assist in the process.
            Process and Deadline:
                Complete the Drop Request Form or email cap@usi.edu with the necessary student and course information.
                The Drop Request Form must be submitted by 4:30 p.m. Central the Friday prior to the final exam.
                The CAP Office creates an official USI drop form, which is emailed to the student, with copies sent to the counselor and instructor (if applicable).
                The student approves the drop by replying to the email or signs the form and emails it back to the CAP Office.
                In case of need, the student can take a picture of the form with their phone and email it or seek assistance from the counselor.
