College of Nursing and Health Professions - Alumni Spotlight on Jessica Lincoln

    Jessica Lincoln is a clinical registered dietitian at Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona, specializing in Gastroenterology and Hepatology.
    She completed her Bachelor of Science in Food and Nutrition - Dietetics at USI in 2016.
    Originally from Palatine, Illinois, she currently lives in Scottsdale, Arizona.
    Jessica fell in love with the USI campus and her future teammates when she visited on an official visit during her senior year of high school.
    She initially thought she wanted to go into food science but fell in love with nutrition, especially in healthcare, during her degree in Nutrition and Dietetics.
    The College of Nursing and Health Professions prepared her well for her career, providing a strong foundation of knowledge and resources.
    Jessica ran Cross Country and Track & Field on scholarship and was a member of the Food and Student Nutrition Organization during her time at USI.
    One of her favorite memories at USI was the morning after dietetic internship match day, celebrating the accomplishment with her professors and fellow students.
    Jessica recommends USI to anyone looking for a school that allows personal and professional growth, with professors who genuinely care about their students' success.
