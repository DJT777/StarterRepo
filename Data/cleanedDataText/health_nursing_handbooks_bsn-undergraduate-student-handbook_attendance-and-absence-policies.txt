College of Nursing and Health Professions - Attendance and Absence Policies

Prompt attendance and preparation for classroom, scheduled learning lab, and clinical experiences are required in the College of Nursing and Health Professions at USI. Faculty maintain attendance records and have the right to dismiss a student from clinical for various reasons, including tardiness, dress code violations, unpreparedness, physical or mental compromise, or unprofessional conduct.

Planned absences for non-university related activities must be pre-approved by the BSN program chair at least one month in advance. The student must complete the Planned Student Absence form, which must be signed by the clinical/seminar/lab faculty and the program chair. Any missed assignments should be completed before the absence, and if the student is absent for an exam, they must take the exam within 24 hours of their return.

If a student will be absent for a university-related activity, the university advisor will notify the faculty. Student athletes are responsible for notifying faculty of expected absences. In both cases, the student is responsible for communicating with course faculty to develop a plan for make-up of missed assignments, clinicals, and/or exams.

Tardiness is considered unprofessional behavior, and two instances of tardiness in the clinical setting will be considered an absence and require a four-hour clinical make-up. Excessive absences and tardiness can impact a student's progression in the nursing program and may lead to dismissal.

Students are expected to be prepared for clinical assignments, and being unprepared may result in dismissal from clinical and the requirement to make up the experience. Lack of preparation for clinical experiences may also result in clinical failure.

Written assignments must be submitted by the announced date, and failure to submit them on time may result in a grade of "0" for the assignment. Clinical make-ups are required for each hour of clinical missed, and the make-up experiences will be directed by course faculty.

The College of Nursing and Health Professions emphasizes the promotion of patient safety and error prevention, and adherence to attendance and absence policies is crucial in achieving this goal.
