We're happy to have you as part of the CNHP Family at USI. Your advisor is here to help you navigate college life and answer any questions you may have. However, please note that your advisor will not wake you up for class or attend class for you. It is important to stay engaged, read your emails, and make appointments to meet with your advisor.

If you're unsure who your advisor is, you can find their name in DegreeWorks on your myUSI account. Simply log in, look for the graduation cap icon (DegreeWorks), and your advisor's name will be listed in the information box at the top. You can also click on your advisor's name to email them.

Incoming freshmen and "pre"-major students are assigned professional academic advisors in the Academic Advising Center. Once accepted into a program, students transition to faculty advisors.

To schedule an appointment with your academic advisor, please use AdvisorTrac on your myUSI EagleApps.

For graduate students and degree completion students, please contact the Program Chair of your program for assistance with your courses.

News: Registration for Spring and Summer 2023 opens on October 24! Make sure to meet with your advisor. If you need to see your advisor, log into myUSI and look for the AdvisorTrac icon.
