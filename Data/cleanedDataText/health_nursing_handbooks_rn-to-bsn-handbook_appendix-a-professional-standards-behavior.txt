Appendix A - Professional Standards & Behavior

The University of Southern Indiana (USI) School of Nursing upholds the highest standards of conduct and professionalism among its students, staff, and faculty. The ANA Code of Ethics serves as a general guide for members of the nursing profession and informs the behavior of all faculty and students. The School of Nursing also adheres to state Nurse Practice Acts, rules, and regulations, as well as University policies and guidelines outlined in the Student Rights and Responsibilities and the USI Nursing Handbooks.

Professional behavior is expected in all settings, including classrooms, clinical settings, learning activities, and any circumstance where a student, faculty, or staff member represents the university. All participants in the School of Nursing are responsible for maintaining and modeling behavior consistent with professional nursing practice. Professionalism is a shared responsibility, requiring individuals to hold themselves accountable for their own conduct while also supporting and encouraging others to behave professionally.

Guiding Principles and Concepts of Professional Behavior:

1. Caring: The ability to demonstrate empathetic concern for others, actively listen, utilize appropriate touch, and integrate nursing knowledge to provide holistic care.
