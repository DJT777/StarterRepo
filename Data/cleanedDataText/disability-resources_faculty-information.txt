Disability Resources for Faculty

    Collaborative Process:
        Providing accommodations in the classroom is a collaborative effort between students, faculty, and Disability Resources (DR).
        Contact DR for any questions or assistance in providing accommodations.

    Goal of Accommodations:
        Accommodations aim to minimize the impact of disabilities and provide equal access to education.
        Accommodations should not require significant changes to the curriculum or essential course elements.
        All students should be required to meet the same course objectives.

    Faculty FAQ's:
        Check the ADA Coordinator's web page for Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) from faculty.

    Testing Accommodations:
        Two options for administering exams:
            Administer exams with approved accommodations yourself.
            Utilize the DR testing area, where student exams can be electronically monitored and recorded upon request.
        
        Submitting Exams:
            Exams can be submitted electronically via the electronic test submission form.
            Exams may also be delivered in person to the DR office, with testing instructions included for each student.
            Exams should be delivered or submitted no later than 4pm the day before testing.

        Additional Information:
            The DR office provides scantrons, basic calculators, and scratch paper for electronically submitted exams.
            Professors can pick up completed exams or request them to be sent via campus mail.
            Adjust exam start times for students with multiple exams in a day to ensure they receive their extended time on each exam.

        Creating an accessible course environment:
            Ensure accessibility for screen reading software for students with vision impairments.
            Use standard page formatting and fonts without serifs.
            Provide good contrast between print and background.
            Avoid using color as the sole means of conveying meaning.
            Create uncluttered pages.
            Consider the needs of students with ADHD and learning disabilities.
            Ensure all videos have accurate captions for students with hearing impairments.
            Make sure required actions can be done with a keyboard for students with physical impairments.
            Avoid Skype, live chats, and telephone conversations for students with speech impairments.
            Prevent attention-grabbing flickers for students with seizure disorders.
