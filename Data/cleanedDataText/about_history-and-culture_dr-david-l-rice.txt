Dr. David L. Rice was the first dean appointed to lead the Evansville campus of Indiana State University in 1967. In 1971, he became the president of the campus and in 1976, he was named the vice president of the main campus. Under his leadership, the Evansville campus eventually became the University of Southern Indiana, a separate state university known for its excellent educational programs and innovative regional outreach projects.

Dr. Rice served as the president of the University of Southern Indiana for 27 years, making him one of the few contemporary university presidents to lead their institution for at least 25 years. His focus during his presidency was on serving students well, improving educational attainment in southern Indiana, positively impacting economic and workforce development, and matching faculty interests with the communities of southern Indiana.

During his tenure, the university experienced significant growth, with enrollment reaching over 7,400 students on a master-planned campus spanning 1,400 acres. Dr. Rice oversaw the expansion of curricula from limited two-year degree programs to a comprehensive range of baccalaureate and master's degree programs. He also established many cooperative programs with other universities.

Notably, under Dr. Rice's leadership, the University of Southern Indiana became the first baccalaureate institution in Indiana to have a degree-transfer articulation agreement with Ivy Tech Community College, which played a key role in the development of a statewide community college system in the state.

Dr. Rice holds bachelor, master, and doctor of philosophy degrees from Purdue University. Prior to his tenure at the University of Southern Indiana, he served as a faculty member and director of Research at Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana. He also held positions in the Cooperative Education Research Laboratory in Indianapolis and the Bureau of Research in the U.S. Office of Education in Washington, D.C.

In addition to his academic career, Dr. Rice was actively involved in various public service organizations and community initiatives. He served as the president of the Board of Commissioners of the Evansville Housing Authority and chaired the Governorâ€™s Citizens Advisory Committee for Title XX of the Social Services Act. He was a founder and president of Leadership Evansville and held leadership roles in several organizations including the United Way, WNIN Channel 9 Public Television, the Buffalo Trace Council Boy Scouts, and the Indiana Public Broadcasting Society.

Dr. Rice received numerous accolades for his public service, including the Junior Achievement Distinguished Business Leader Award, Salvation Army Service to Others Award, West Side Civitan Citizen of the Year, and the Rotary Civic Award, among others. In recognition of his leadership at the University of Southern Indiana, the USI Faculty Senate and USI Alumni Council endowed scholarships in his name. The University Library was also named in his honor, and both Dr. Rice and his wife received honorary doctorates from USI.

After retiring from the presidency, Dr. Rice and his wife moved to New Harmony, Indiana, where they actively engaged in historic preservation and community restoration projects. He led the funding campaign and directed the restoration of the Rapp Owen Granary, which now serves as an important center for historical and cultural events in New Harmony. Additionally, he advocated for state and federal funding to stabilize and reopen the bi-state bridge between New Harmony and Illinois in his role as a commissioner for the project.
