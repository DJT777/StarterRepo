What is the College Achievement Program?
The CAP is a program that allows high school students to earn college credit by taking USI courses taught by approved high school instructors. Students receive both USI and high school credit for these courses. CAP courses are real USI courses and require a higher level of academic commitment.

Student Qualifications and Prerequisites:
To enroll in CAP, students should have:
- Minimum cumulative high school GPA of 2.5 (based on a 4.0 scale)
- Junior or senior status
- Clearance of past-due balances from previous semesters
- Meeting additional criteria for specific courses, as required

Students with Disabilities (ADA Policy):
CAP welcomes students with disabilities who meet the eligibility standards. High schools are responsible for providing and coordinating any necessary accommodations or services based on the student's current IEP, 504 Plan, or similar educational plan. However, it is important to note that college-level accommodations may differ from those in high school. Students are encouraged to review their current accommodations and make modifications, if necessary, before enrolling in CAP.

Registration Procedures:
Registration timelines and procedures may vary depending on the high school's academic calendar. Students should commit to year-long or fall-only CAP courses during fall registration. Spring-only high school courses will have a separate spring registration. Deadlines and specific details will be shared by the CAP instructor.

Benefits of Being a CAP Student:
CAP students have access to USI advising centers, the myUSI student portal, Rice Library resources, Academic Skills Office tutoring, and Rice Library study rooms. However, CAP students do not have access to on-campus activities, fitness centers, or counseling centers.

Transferability of CAP Credits:
Transferability of CAP credits varies among colleges and universities. Some institutions require official transcripts to consider the transfer of CAP credits. CAP staff can provide assistance if students encounter difficulties with credit transfer. Students are advised to research transfer policies of their intended college or university before enrolling in CAP.

Withdrawing from CAP Courses:
Students should be aware of the Withdrawal Calendar, which determines deadlines for course withdrawals. It is the student's responsibility to submit withdrawal paperwork within the specified timeframe. Failure to withdraw properly may result in a failing grade.

Undergraduate Admission to USI:
Participating in CAP does not guarantee undergraduate admission to USI. Students who plan to attend USI after high school graduation must complete a separate application for undergraduate admission. It is recommended to apply no later than March 1 of the intended entry year.

Grade and GPA Calculation:
CAP course grades are recorded on the student's USI transcript. These grades are based on the same criteria as high school grades. Students can access their final USI grades through the myUSI student portal. GPA is calculated based on the USI grading scale.

FERPA Regulations:
FERPA protects the privacy of student education records. Only directory information can be released without written permission. USI considers directory information to include elements such as name, address, email, curriculum, enrollment status, and more. Parents may have access to certain information depending on the circumstances and proof of dependency.

CAP World Language Courses:
Specific procedures apply to CAP world language courses. Successful completion of certain CAP language courses can earn students credit hours toward college graduation. The CAP staff can provide detailed information on these procedures.

High School Agreement Program:
USI offers a High School Agreement Program for students who want to take courses on the USI campus. Additional details and an application can be found on the USI website.

Preferred Name Change:
USI allows students to use a preferred first name that differs from their legal name in certain situations. However, the last name must remain the same as the legal name. The University reserves the right to refuse a preferred name change under certain circumstances.

Transfer of CAP Credits:
If students plan to attend USI as degree-seeking students, their CAP credits are automatically recorded in the USI system. To transfer CAP credits to another university, students must request an official USI transcript to be sent directly to the chosen institution.

Additional Information:
The Student Guide provides comprehensive information about CAP policies and procedures. If students have any questions or concerns, they should reach out to the CAP staff for assistance.
