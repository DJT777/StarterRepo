Property Accounting in the Business Office

Property Accounting is responsible for managing and tracking capital equipment at the University of Southern Indiana (USI).

Purpose:

- Tag newly purchased capital equipment with a "Property of University of Southern Indiana" label.
- Enter capital equipment into the Fixed Asset Control System, including information such as the responsible person, total cost, account number, vendor name, building, and room number.
- Conduct an annual inventory with the department's assistance.
- Perform routine spot checks throughout the year.
- Pass annual audits conducted by university auditors and the State Board of Account Auditors.

Capital Assets:

- Individual items valued at $5,000 or more are generally tagged, including systems with a total value of $5,000 or more.
- Exceptions include University vehicles, grounds equipment, cleaning equipment, and furniture.
- Items valued under $5,000 are not generally tagged, except for those on the University Maintenance Pool.

Tagging:

- Items are tagged once they have been paid for by the Accounts Payable Department.
- The control system coordinator receives an asset report twice monthly and coordinates the labeling process.

Inventory Process:

- The University conducts an annual inventory of fixed assets.
- Reports of capital items are produced by the Buyer/Fixed Asset Coordinator.
- Physical inventory is conducted and necessary changes are made in the Fixed Asset Control System.
- Changes may include new locations, added items, disposed items, sold items, or items in storage.
- Results of the inventory are kept for audit purposes.

Transfer or Disposal of University Property:

- Departments contact the Procurement Office for instructions when an item is no longer wanted.
- The Procurement Office attempts to redistribute the item within the university.
- If there is no need for the item within the university, it may be sold or disposed of through various methods.
- Unusable property or parts are properly discarded as instructed by the Procurement Department.

Property Policy:

- Fixed assets are maintained in accordance with GASB 34/35, which requires depreciation for not-for-profit organizations.
- Equipment with a useful life of more than two years and an acquisition cost of more than $5,000 is capitalized.
- Repairs to capital assets may also be capitalized if they extend the item's life.
- Real property assets, such as buildings, are divided into functional units with different useful lives.
- Improvements to real property are also capitalized.

Off Campus Use of Capital Equipment:

- Employees must receive approval from the college dean or department's financial manager to use property away from campus.
- The use and approval must be in writing or electronically recorded and kept on file with the approving authority.
- The equipment must be used for University purposes only and returned in satisfactory condition.
- The employee assumes liability for repair and/or replacement costs of any property not returned in satisfactory condition.
