Emergency Action Plan

Purpose: The policy outlines the emergency action plan at the University of Southern Indiana (USI) in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations.

Policy Statement: The University is committed to notifying all employees, students, and visitors of the emergency evacuation plan and expects everyone to understand and follow the plan.

Responsibility:

- Each department head is responsible for enforcing the policy.
- Failure to adhere to the policy may result in disciplinary action.
- Building occupants must evacuate during a fire alarm.
- Employees who do not evacuate should be reported to their supervisor.
- Environmental Health and Safety is responsible for notifying employees of the emergency action plan and providing information through the Risk Management and Environmental Health and Safety website.

Evacuation Plans: Evacuation plans are provided for residence hall buildings, and plans for academic buildings are being revised and updated.

Emergency Action Plan Elements:

1. Emergency evacuation procedures and route assignments.
2. Procedures for employees conducting critical functions before evacuating.
3. Procedures for accounting for all employees after evacuation.
4. Rescue and medical duties for designated employees.
5. Contact information for further information or explanation of duties under the plan.
6. Reporting procedures for fires and other emergencies.

Emergency Evacuation Procedures and Route Assignments:

- Activate the fire alarm system.
- Call Security from a safe location.
- Close doors.
- Proceed to the nearest accessible exit.
- Do not use elevators.
- Assemble in the designated area.
- Do not re-enter the building until instructed by officials.
- Specific evacuation procedures for individuals with disabilities are outlined.
- Employees conducting critical functions should only perform duties if they are not in the smoke/fire area.

Accounting for all Persons after Emergency Evacuation: Supervisors should develop procedures to account for employees, students, and visitors after evacuation. They should designate an assembly area outside the building and inform emergency responders about anyone still inside the building.

Rescue and Medical Duties: Injured employees will receive rescue and medical treatment from the responding fire department and EMS unit.

Preferred Means for Reporting Fires: The preferred means for reporting a fire is by activating the fire alarm system and calling Security immediately.

Names or Titles of Contacts for Further Information: Contact the manager for Environmental Health and Safety for information about the plan.

Building Fire Alarm System: Buildings are equipped with fire alarm systems, and occupants must evacuate immediately upon hearing the alarm. Faculty members and instructors should assist students in exiting the building. Exceptions to remaining in the building only apply to designated personnel operating or shutting down critical systems.

Training: All employees must be trained on the emergency action plan, including evacuation procedures, accounting for evacuated employees, assistance for physically impaired employees, procedures for employees temporarily remaining behind, and the means of alerting employees to a fire emergency.
