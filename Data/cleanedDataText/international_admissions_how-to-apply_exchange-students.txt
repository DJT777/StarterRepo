Exchange Students at the University of Southern Indiana

Application Process:
    Exchange students should begin the process with the international office at their home institution.
    The application process and requirements are determined by the home institution or sponsoring organization (such as ISEP).

Admission:
    Exchange students are admitted to USI as non-degree students for the duration of the exchange program.

DS-2019 Form:
    Once the exchange placement is finalized, exchange students receive a DS-2019 form from the program sponsor (University of Southern Indiana, ISEP, etc.).
    The DS-2019 form is required to obtain the J-1 exchange visitor visa.
