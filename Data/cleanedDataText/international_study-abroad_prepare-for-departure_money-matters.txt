Money Matters for Study Abroad

Planning a budget before leaving the U.S. is essential when studying abroad. The program fee may cover tuition and housing, but you need to bring enough funds for other expenses such as books, local transportation, personal items, snacks, travel, and other incidental expenses. The amount needed for incidental expenses depends on your lifestyle and local costs. It's important to consider exchange rates, foreign transaction fees, and differences in spending power.

Study Abroad Budget Worksheet: Creating a budget is crucial for preparing for your study abroad experience. The Study Abroad Budget Worksheet provided covers example expenses you may incur before going abroad and while you are there.

Cash: It's best not to bring large amounts of cash. It's advisable to have some cash before entering your host country, but you can change a small amount at the airport or withdraw money from an ATM. Carrying cash is risky, so using an ATM or credit card is recommended.

Credit Cards: Major credit cards (e.g., Mastercard, Visa) are generally accepted abroad. They are useful for larger purchases, emergencies, and cash advances. However, be aware that credit card companies may charge higher interest rates for cash advances. Credit cards provide exchange rate conversion on the day of the transaction, which may differ from the rate at the time of purchase. Be cautious about accumulating debt and inform your credit card company of your overseas travel plans in advance.

Debit Cards: A debit card linked to your U.S. bank account allows you to withdraw money in the currency of your host country from ATMs with Visa or Mastercard logos. The debit card deducts funds from your checking account at the current exchange rate, usually without commissions. Ensure your card has the Visa or Mastercard symbol and check with your bank for transaction fees.

Opening a Bank Account: In some countries, you may want to open a local bank account upon arrival. Many banks provide checking and savings accounts and may allow you to maintain your funds in U.S. dollars. Compare services and costs before choosing a bank.

Advances/Check Cashing: Credit cards can provide cash advances, but they often charge high interest rates and limit the amount to your credit line. Wire transfers or check cashing services like American Express may be alternatives.

Taxes: Understand your tax responsibilities and arrange for tax forms or payment while abroad. Requesting a filing extension may be possible.

Export Controls (Legal): Understand the U.S. government's export control laws and regulations when taking controlled items, technology, or information abroad. Compliance is necessary.
