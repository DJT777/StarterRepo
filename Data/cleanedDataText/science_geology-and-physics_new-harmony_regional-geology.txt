Regional Geology of Southwest Indiana

Southwest Indiana is located on the eastern flank of the Illinois Basin, where the Ohio and Wabash Rivers converge. This area has a rich history of geologic discovery, starting from the early 19th Century studies conducted near New Harmony and research focused on the seismic risk along the Wabash Valley Fault Zone.

The bedrock underlying the region is from the Pennsylvanian age and consists of alternating layers of sandstone, shale, coal, and limestone. The southern limit of Illinoian glaciation is also marked on the geologic map of southwest Indiana.

There are several sites near New Harmony of geologic significance. These sites were studied by notable geologists such as Edward Travers Cox, Charles Alexandre Lesueur, David Dale Owen, Richard Owen, and Gerard Troost in the 19th Century. Additionally, Leo Lesquereux and Sir Charles Lyell visited these sites.

New Harmony itself is underlain by sandstones, limestones, shales, and coal of the Bond Formation (Pennsylvanian). The bedrock is overlain by either floodplain deposits of the Wabash River or wind-blown silt (loess) deposited during the last Ice Age.

Important localities for early geologists near New Harmony include:
1. Mumford Hills: Erosional remnant of loess and/or marl deposits, possibly fault-controlled.
2. Blairsville locality: Famous exposures of Pennsylvanian-aged stumps of Didymophyllum owenii.
3. Loess: Sir Charles Lyell recognized this sediment as wind-blown during his visit to D.D. Owen.
4. Cut-Off/Dam Site: Sandstone and limestone exposures studied by D.D. Owen, R. Owen, G. Troost, and E. Cox.
5. Rush Creek: Plant fossil locality visited by D.D. Owen and Sir Charles Lyell, extensively studied by J. Sampson, E. Cox, and C.A. Lesueur.
