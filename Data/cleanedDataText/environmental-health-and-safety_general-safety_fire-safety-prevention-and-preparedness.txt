Fire Safety Measures

- The University has implemented a Fire Prevention Plan to reduce the risk of fire-related incidents and injuries.
- Policies are based on the belief that most fires are preventable and everyone in the University community has a responsibility to prevent fires.
- Faculty, staff, and students should be aware of potential fire hazards on campus.
- Emergency procedures should be followed in the event of a fire.
- Fire safety programs are in place for students living in campus residence halls.
- Fire evacuation plans have been developed for each residence hall.
- Specific fire safety programs are available for Physical Plant employees and campus contractors.
- Red Tag Permits are used to remind workers to return equipment to service after repairs.
- Hot work permits are required for contractors, employees, and students working with torches and other hot sources.

Fire Prevention Plan

- OSHA's Fire Prevention Plan regulation requires a written plan addressing fire emergencies on campus.
- The plan includes information about fire hazards, handling and storage procedures, potential ignition sources, fire protection equipment, personnel responsibilities, etc.
- Faculty, staff, and students are informed about the plan's purpose, reporting procedures, evacuations, and alarm systems.

Fire Evacuation Drills

- Fire drills are conducted twice a year in all campus buildings, including Housing and Residence Life apartments and residence halls.
- The purpose is to prepare occupants for an organized evacuation in case of fire or other emergencies.
- During drills, occupants practice evacuation procedures and familiarize themselves with exits and the sound of fire alarms.
- Environmental Health and Safety, Security, and Housing and Residence Life monitor and evaluate the drills to identify any deficiencies.

Fire Extinguisher Usage

- Fire extinguishers function by removing one of the four components required for fire: oxygen, fuel, heat, and a chemical chain reaction.
- Extinguishers are rated based on the types of fires they are designed to put out.
- The University uses different types of fire extinguishers, such as water, carbon dioxide, multipurpose dry chemical, and dry powder.
- The PASS procedure (Pull, Aim, Squeeze, Sweep) should be followed when operating a fire extinguisher.
- It is important to know the type of fuel burning and to position oneself with an exit at the back before attempting to extinguish a fire.

Common Fire Hazards

- Arson, cooking, smoking materials, open flames, electrical hazards, residential furnishings, accumulations of combustible materials, improper handling and storage of combustible/flammable liquids, halogen lamps, space heaters, hot work hazards.
- Space heaters should be used minimally on campus, and inquiries about space heater rules can be directed to the Environmental Health & Safety Manager.
